<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Disconnect the diesel fuel supply pipe at the fuel filter inlet and seal it with a plug.

</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Connect a pipe to the fuel filter inlet and insert the other end in a clean container of approximately 5 liters.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Disconnect the diesel fuel return pipe at the pump return and injector leak-off junction and seal it with a plug.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Fill the container with clean diesel fuel.
