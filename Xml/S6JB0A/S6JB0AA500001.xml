The keyless start system executes data transmission&#x002F;reception by means of the radio wave. Therefore, proper operation may not be obtained if use of the door lock function and engine start function of the keyless start system is attempted near the place where strong radio wave is emitted (TV and radio broadcasting stations, etc.).

Diagnostic information stored in keyless start control module memory can be checked only by key indicator light.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Be sure to use the trouble diagnosis procedure as described in 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0AA504004">Keyless Start System Check</intxref>
. Failure to follow it may result in incorrect diagnosis. (Some other DTC may be stored by mistake in the memory of keyless start control module during inspection.)

Be sure to read 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0A0000007">Precautions for Electrical Circuit Service</intxref>
 before inspection and observe what is written there.

Communication of ECM, BCM, TCM (A&#x002F;T model), 4WD control module (if equipped), ABS or ESP&#174; control module, keyless start control module, steering angle sensor (if equipped) and combination meter is established by CAN (Controller Area Network). (For detail of CAN communication for keyless start control module, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0AA501007">CAN Communication System Description</intxref>
). Therefore, handle CAN communication line with care referring to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0A0000006">Precaution for CAN Communication System</intxref>

Replacement of the keyless start control module
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When keyless start control module is replaced with new one, make sure that register remote controller ID code to Keyless start control module correctly according to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0AA506009">Registration Procedure for Remote Controller ID Code</intxref>
.

Keyless start control module substitution
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When the keyless start control module used in another vehicle was installed in the vehicle being serviced, register the ID code of the remote controller to the keyless start control module first and then the following code.

For petrol engine model with immobilizer control system, register the ignition key transponder code for the immobilizer control system in ECM. For registration procedure of that, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0AA316002">Registration of the Ignition Key:For Petrol Engine Model</intxref>
.
</ptxt>

<item>
<ptxt>
For petrol engine model without immobilizer control system, register the steering lock unit ID code in keyless start control module. For registration procedure of that, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0AA506010">Keyless Start Registration</intxref>
.

For diesel engine model, register the ID code of the keyless start control module in ECM. ID code of the keyless start control module is registered automatically by registering the password and SECRET KEY CODE to ECM. For the registration procedure of that, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0AA326003">Procedure after ECM Replacement:For Diesel Engine Model</intxref>
