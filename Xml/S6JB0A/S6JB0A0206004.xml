Before draining engine oil, check engine for oil leakage. If any evidence of leakage is found, make sure to correct defective part before proceeding to the following work.
</ptxt>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Drain engine oil by removing drain plug.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
After draining oil, wipe drain plug clean. Reinstall drain plug.

Replenish oil until oil level is brought to FULL level mark on dipstick. (oil pan and oil filter capacity). The filler inlet is at the top of the cylinder head cover. 
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Use only engine oil of SG, SH, SJ, SL or SM grade.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Select the appropriate oil viscosity according to the chart &#x005B;A&#x005D;.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
It is highly recommended to use SAE 5W-30 oil.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
However, SAE 10W-30 oil is usable for ambient temperatures above &#8211;18 &#176;C (0 &#176;F).
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
Engine oil capacity is specified below. However, note that the amount of oil required when actually changing oil may somewhat differ from the data depending on various conditions (temperature, viscosity, etc.)
