Seat Belt with ELR
</title>
<ptxt>
The seat belt with emergency locking retractor (ELR) is designed so that it locks immediately (to prevent the webbing from being pulled out of the retractor any further) when any of the following items is detected as exceeding each set value;
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Speed at which the webbing is pulled out of the retractor.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle speed.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Inclination.

<title>
Seat Belt with A-ELR
</title>
<ptxt>
The automatic and emergency locking retractor (A-ELR) works as an Emergency Locking Retractor (ELR) till its webbing is pulled all the way out and then on as an Automatic Locking Retractor (ALR) till it is retracted fully.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
ALR: Automatically locks when the webbing is pulled out from the retractor and allowed to retract even a little. Then the webbing can not be pulled out any further, unless it is wound all the way back into the retractor, which releases the lock and allows the webbing to be pulled out.

Seat Belt with ELR and Pretensioner
</title>
<ptxt>
The seat belt with ELR and a pretensioner has a pretensioner mechanism which operates in linkage with the air bag in addition to the ELR.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The pretensioner is incorporated in retractor assembly and controlled by SDM as one of air bag system components. It will be activated at the same time as the driver and passenger air bag module when an impact at the front of vehicle exceeds the specified value.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When servicing seat belt (retractor assembly) with pretensioner, be sure to observe all WARNINGS and CAUTIONS and 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0A8200001">Precautions on Service and Diagnosis of Air Bag System</intxref>
. 
</ptxt>
<attention2>
<ptxt>
Do not reuse the seat belt pretensioner (retractor assembly) that has activated. Replace it with a new seat belt assembly and buckle together as a set. For checking procedure of its activation, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0A8204041">Repair and Inspection Required after Accident</intxref>
.

Seat Belt Remainder (if equipped)
</title>
<ptxt>
When driver&#8217;s seat belt is unfastened (under the following conditions), seat belt reminder light and warning buzzer inform that driver&#8217;s seat belt is unfastened. Seat belt reminder light located in combination meter and warning buzzer located inside BCM operate as follows:
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Seat belt reminder light comes on when driver&#8217;s seat belt is unfastened while ignition key switch is at ON position.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
If vehicle speed exceeds 15 km&#x002F;h with seat belt unfastened, warning buzzer operates for approximately 95 seconds and seat belt reminder light flashes synchronously with buzzer. When warning buzzer stops operating, seat belt reminder light is turned on.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
If driver&#8217;s seat belt state is changed from &#8220;fastened&#8221; to &#8220;unfastened&#8221; while vehicle speed is above 15 km&#x002F;h, warning buzzer operates for approximately 95 seconds and seat belt reminder light flashes synchronously with buzzer. When warning buzzer stops operating, seat belt reminder light is turned on.
