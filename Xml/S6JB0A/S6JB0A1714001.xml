Fuel Pressure Inspection
</title>
<attention1>
<ptxt>
Before starting the following procedure, be sure to observe 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0A1710001">Precautions on Fuel System Service:For Petrol Engine Model</intxref>
 in order to reduce the risk or fire and personal injury.
</ptxt>
</attention1>

<ptxt>
Relieve fuel pressure in fuel feed line referring to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0A1716003">Fuel Pressure Relief Procedure:For Petrol Engine Model</intxref>
.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Disconnect fuel feed hose from fuel delivery pipe.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Connect special tools and hose between fuel feed hose (1) and fuel delivery pipe as shown in the figure, and clamp hoses securely in order to ensure that no leaks occur during checking.

Measure fuel pressure at each condition.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If measured pressure is out of specification, refer to
