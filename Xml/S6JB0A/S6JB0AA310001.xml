DTC stored in ECM memory can be checked as well as cleared by using SUZUKI scan tool. Before using SUZUKI scan tool, read its operator&#8217;s manual carefully to know how to use it and what functions are available.

Communication of ECM, BCM, combination meter, TCM, keyless start control module (if equipped), ABS&#x002F;ESP&#174; control module, 4WD control module (if equipped), Steering angle sensor (if equipped) and DLC is established by CAN (Computer Area Network). (For more detail of CAN communication, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0A1111005">CAN Communication System Description:For Petrol Engine Model</intxref>
) Therefore, handle CAN communication lines with care referring to
