Balancing Wheels Description
</title>
<ptxt>
There are two types of wheel and tire balance: static and dynamic. Static balance, as shown in figure, is the equal distribution of weight around the wheel. Wheels that are statically unbalanced cause a bouncing action called tramp. This condition will eventually cause uneven tire wear.

Dynamic balance, as shown in figure, is the equal distribution of weight on each side of the wheel centerline so that when the tire spins there is no tendency for the assembly to move from side to side. Wheels that are dynamically unbalanced may cause shimmy.
