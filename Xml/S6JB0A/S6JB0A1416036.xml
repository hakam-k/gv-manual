Out-of-Round and Taper (Uneven Wear) of Journals
</title>
<ptxt>
An unevenly worn crankshaft journal shows up as a difference in diameter at a cross section or along its length (or both). This difference, if any, is determined by taking micrometer readings. If any one of journals is badly damaged or if amount of uneven wear in the sense exceeds its limit, regrind or replace crankshaft.
