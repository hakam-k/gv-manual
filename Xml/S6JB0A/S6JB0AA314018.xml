<ptxt>
Immobilizer control module (ICM) and its circuit can be checked at immobilizer control module (ICM) wiring connector by measuring voltage.
</ptxt>
<attention2>
<ptxt>
Immobilizer control module (ICM) cannot be checked by itself. It is strictly prohibited to connect voltmeter or ohmmeter to immobilizer control module (ICM) with connector disconnected from it.

<ptxt>
Check voltage at each terminal.
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
As each terminal voltage is affected by the battery voltage, confirm that it is 11 V or more when the ignition switch is turned to ON position.
