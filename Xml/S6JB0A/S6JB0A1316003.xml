Electric Throttle Body Assembly On-Vehicle Inspection
</title>
<attention1>
<ptxt>
Never touch throttle valve with finger while ignition switch is turned ON and accelerator pedal is depressed. Otherwise, injury may result by pinching the finger between throttle valve and throttle body housing.
</ptxt>
</attention1>
<attention2>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Do not disassemble electric throttle body assembly.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Do not expose electric throttle body assembly to excessive shock like a dropping it. If electric throttle body assembly has been exposed to excessive shock, it should be replaced.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Be careful not to accrete a foreign material (like dust and&#x002F;or metallic particle) to the throttle body housing and&#x002F;or throttle valve.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Otherwise, the throttle body assembly is breaking down by throttle valve accretion.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Do not apply excessive moving force to throttle valve for throttle valve operation check and&#x002F;or TP sensor performance check.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Otherwise, the throttle body assembly is breaking down by damaging the internal resinous gear of throttle valve actuator.
