Before applying hoist to underbody, always take vehicle balance throughout service into consideration. Vehicle balance on hoist may change depending of what part to be removed.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Before lifting up the vehicle, check to be sure that end of hoist arm is not in contact with brake pipe, fuel pipe, bracket or any other part.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
When using frame contact hoist, apply hoist as shown (right and left at the same position). Lift up the vehicle till 4 tires are a little off the ground and make sure that the vehicle will not fall off by trying to move vehicle body in both ways. Work can be started only after this confirmation.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>

When using floor jack
</title>
<attention1>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
If the vehicle to be jacked up only at the front or rear end, be sure to block the wheels on ground in order to ensure safety.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
After the vehicle is jacked up, be sure to support it on stands. It is extremely dangerous to do any work on the vehicle raised on jack alone.
</ptxt>

<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Never apply jack against engine under cover, suspension parts (i.e., stabilizer, etc.) or vehicle floor, or it may get damaged.
</ptxt>
</item>
</list1>
</attention2>
<ptxt>
In raising front or rear vehicle end off the floor by jacking, be sure to put the jack against the center portion of the front suspension frame (1) or rear differential (2).

To perform service with either front or rear vehicle end jacked up, be sure to place safety stands (1) under chassis frame so that body is securely supported. 
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
And then check to ensure that chassis frame does not slide on safety stands (1) and the vehicle is held stable for safety&#8217;s sake.
