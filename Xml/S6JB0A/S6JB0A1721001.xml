Fuel System Description
</title>
<attention2>
<ptxt>
This engine requires the unleaded fuel only. The leaded and&#x002F;or low lead fuel can result in engine damage and reduce the effectiveness of the emission control system.

Low-pressure fuel supply circuit &#x005B;A&#x005D;
</title>
<ptxt>
The fuel in the fuel tank (1) is pumped up to the high pressure fuel supply circuit &#x005B;B&#x005D; through the priming pump (2), the fuel filter (3) and the fuel heater (4) by the low pressure fuel pump (5) built in the injection pump (6).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The fuel pump assembly (7) is composed of a fuel pump (8) a fuel suction filter (9), a main fuel level gauge (10) and a jet pump (11). The fuel pump is an in-tank type electric pump, and the fuel pump is equipped only for the jet pump. The jet pump sucks up the fuel from the sub fuel level gauge side (12) to the main fuel level gauge side (13) through the fuel suction pipe&#x002F;hose (14) by using the negative pressure produced when the pressured fuel (15) with the fuel pump passes the venturi (16).

<title>
High-pressure fuel supply circuit &#x005B;B&#x005D;
</title>
<ptxt>
The injection pump (6) driven by engine rotation creates high-pressure fuel from the low pressure fuel. The high-pressure fuel is supplied to the common rail (17) through the high-pressure fuel pipe. And, the injectors (18) atomize the fuel in the cylinders.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The fuel flow actuator (19) located on the injection pump regulates the quantity of fuel to the injection pump by ECM signal in order to control the fuel pressure in the common rail.
