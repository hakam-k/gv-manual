System Description
</title>
<ptxt>
The CMP sensor located on the transmission side of cylinder head (for M16 engine) or cylinder head cover (for J20 engine) consists of the signal generator (magnetic sensor) and signal rotor (intake camshaft portion).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The signal generator generates reference signal through slits in the slit plate which turns together with the camshaft.
</ptxt>
<topic id = "S6JB0A1114043003">
<title>
Reference signal
</title>
<ptxt>
The CMP sensor generates 6 pulses of signals each of which has a different waveform length while the camshaft makes one full rotation. Refer to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0A1114080">Inspection of ECM and Its Circuits:For Petrol Engine Model</intxref>
.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Based on these signals, ECM judges which cylinder piston is in the compression stroke and the engine speed.
