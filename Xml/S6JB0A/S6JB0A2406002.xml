Tire Rotation
</title>
<ptxt>
To equalize wear, rotate tires according to figure. Radial tires should be rotated periodically. Set tire pressure.
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
Due to their design, radial tires tend to wear faster in the shoulder area, particularly in front positions. This makes regular rotation especially necessary.
