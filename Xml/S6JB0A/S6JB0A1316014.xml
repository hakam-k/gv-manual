Arrange 12 V battery (1) and connect its positive terminal to &#8220;Vin&#8221; terminal (2) and negative terminal to &#8220;Ground&#8221; terminal (3) of sensor. Then using ohmmeter, measure resistance between &#8220;Vout&#8221; terminal (4) of sensor and negative terminal of battery by passing magnetic substance (iron) (5) while keeping approximately 1 mm (0.03 in.) gap with respect to end face of CMP sensor.

If resistance does not vary as specified below, replace CMP sensor.
