HVAC control module has a function to make initial settings of temperature control actuator, air intake actuator and air flow actuator.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
For vehicle without A&#x002F;C, HVAC control module uses engine speed signal so that temperature control actuator, air intake actuator and air flow actuator can make initial setting for door position.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Initial settings of actuators are automatically made when engine is started for the first time after battery is connected.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When initial settings are made, each actuator is forced to operate for about 15 seconds continuously.
