Conditions for applying the fault finding procedure to stored faults:
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The fault is declared present after several starting attempts, or with the engine running.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Computer operating voltage: 9 V &lt; operating voltage &lt; 16 V.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Battery voltage that is too low can cause the Injection warning light (gravity 1 warning light) to come on thereby causing other faults to appear.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Use service wire for all operations on the ECM connectors.
