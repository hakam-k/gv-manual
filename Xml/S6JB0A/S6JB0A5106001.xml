A&#x002F;T Fluid Level Check
</title>
<servinfosub id = "S6JB0A5106001001">
<title>
At Normal Operating Temperature
</title>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Drive vehicle so that A&#x002F;T fluid temperature reach the normal operating temperature (70 &#8211; 80 &#176;C (158 &#8211; 176 &#176;F)).
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Stop vehicle with engine running and place it level.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
With select lever at &#8220;P&#8221; range, apply parking brake and place chocks against wheels.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Keep engine idling and shift selector slowly to &#8220;L&#8221; and back to &#8220;P&#8221; range.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
With engine idling, pull out dipstick (1), wipe it off with a clean cloth and put it back into place.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Pull out dipstick (1) again and check fluid level indicated on it. Fluid level should be between FULL HOT and LOW HOT. If it is below LOW HOT, add specified A&#x002F;T fluid up to FULL HOT.

<ptxt>
DO NOT RACE ENGINE while checking fluid level, even after engine is started.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
DO NOT OVERFILL. Overfilling can causes foaming and loss of fluid through breather. Then slippage and transmission failure can result.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
If vehicle was driven under high load such as pulling a trailer, fluid level should be checked about half an hour after it is stopped.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
When checking oil level, oil level gauge must be used in proper direction. Insert oil level gauge so that its front or back face is directed to the front of vehicle. When oil level indicated on front face of oil level gauge differs from that on back face, use lower one.

At Room Temperature
</title>
<ptxt>
The fluid level check at room temperature performed after repair or fluid change before test driving is just preparation for level check of normal operating temperature. The checking procedure itself is the same as that described in &#8220;At Normal Operating Temperature&#8221; under 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0A5106001">A&#x002F;T Fluid Level Check</intxref>
. If the fluid level is between FULL COLD and LOW COLD, proceed to test drive. And when the fluid temperature has reached the normal operating temperature, check fluid level again and adjust it as necessary.
