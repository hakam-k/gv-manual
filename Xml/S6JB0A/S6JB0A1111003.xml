On-Board Diagnostic System Description

<servinfosub id = "S6JB0A1111003001">
<title>
Euro OBD Model
</title>
<ptxt>
ECM in this vehicle has the following functions.
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
When the ignition switch is turned ON with the engine at a stop, malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) (1) turns ON to check the circuit of the malfunction indicator lamp (1).
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
When ECM detects a malfunction which gives an adverse effect to vehicle emission while the engine is running, it makes the malfunction indicator lamp (1) in the meter cluster of the instrument panel turn ON or flash (flashing only when detecting a misfire which can cause damage to the catalyst) and stores the malfunction area in its memory.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
(If it detects that continuously 3 driving cycles are normal after detecting a malfunction, however, it makes MIL (1) turn OFF although DTC stored in its memory will remain.)
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
As a condition for detecting a malfunction in some areas in the system being monitored by ECM and turning ON the malfunction indicator lamp (1) due to that malfunction, 2 driving cycle detection logic is adopted to prevent erroneous detection.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
When a malfunction is detected, engine and driving conditions then are stored in ECM memory as freeze frame data. (For the details, refer to description on 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0A1111003007">Freeze Frame Data (Euro OBD Model)</intxref>
.)
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
It is possible to communicate by using not only SUZUKI scan tool (2) but also OBD generic scan tool. (Diagnostic information can be accessed by using a scan tool.)

ECM and malfunction indicator lamp (1) operate as follows.
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Malfunction indicator lamp (1) lights when the ignition switch is turned ON (but the engine at stop) with the diagnosis switch terminal ungrounded regardless of the condition of Engine and Emission control system. This is only to check the malfunction indicator lamp (1) in the combination meter and its circuit.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
If the above areas of Engine and Emission control system is free from any trouble after the engine start (while engine is running), malfunction indicator lamp (1) turns OFF.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
When ECM detects a trouble which has occurred in the above areas, it makes malfunction indicator lamp (1) turn ON while the engine is running to warn the driver of such occurrence of trouble and at the same time it stores the trouble area in ECM back-up memory. (The memory is kept as it is even if the trouble was only temporary and disappeared immediately. And it is not erased unless the power to ECM is shut off for specified time or it is cleared by SUZUKI scan tool (2).)
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Diagnostic information can be accessed by using SUZUKI scan tool.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
In addition, for vehicle equipped with diagnosis connector, DTC can be read by not only using SUZUKI scan tool but also displayed on odometer (5) of the combination meter. (i.e. when diagnosis switch terminal (3) is grounded with a service wire (4) and ignition switch is turned ON.) For further detail of the checking procedure, refer to

A warm-up cycle means sufficient vehicle operation such that the coolant temperature has risen by at least 22 &#176;C (40 &#176;F) from engine starting and reaches a minimum temperature of 70 &#176;C (160 &#176;F).

Freeze Frame Data (Euro OBD Model)
</title>
<ptxt>
ECM stores the engine and driving conditions (in the form of data as shown in the figure) at the moment of the detection of a malfunction in its memory. This data is called &#8220;Freeze frame data&#8221;.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Therefore, it is possible to know engine and driving conditions (e.g., whether the engine was warm or not, where the vehicle was running or stopped, where air&#x002F;fuel mixture was lean or rich) when a malfunction was detected by checking the freeze frame data. Also, ECM has a function to store each freeze frame data for three different malfunctions in the order as each malfunction is detected. Utilizing this function, it is possible to know the order of malfunctions that have been detected. Its use is helpful when rechecking or diagnosing a trouble.
