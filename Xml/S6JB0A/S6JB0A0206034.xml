Differential Oil Inspection
</title>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Check differential for evidence of oil leakage.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Repair leaky point if any.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Make sure that vehicle is placed level for oil level check.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Remove level &#x002F; filler plug of differentials (front and&#x002F;or rear) and check oil level.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Oil level can be checked roughly by means of level plug hole. That is, if oil flows out of level plug hole or if oil level is found up to hole when level &#x002F; filler plug is removed, oil is properly filled.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If oil is found insufficient, pour specified amount of specified oil.
