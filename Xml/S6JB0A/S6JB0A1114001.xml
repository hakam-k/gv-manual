Step 2: DTC &#x002F; Freeze Frame Data Check, Record and Clearance
</title>
<ptxt>
First, check DTC (including pending DTC), referring to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0A1114003">DTC Check:For Petrol Engine Model</intxref>
. If DTC is indicated, print it and freeze frame data or write them down and then clear them by referring to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0A1114004">DTC Clearance:For Petrol Engine Model</intxref>
. DTC indicates malfunction that occurred in the system but does not indicate whether it exists now or it occurred in the past and the normal condition has been restored now. To check which case applies, check the symptom in question according to Step 5 and recheck DTC according to Step 6 and 7.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Attempt to diagnose a trouble based on DTC in this step only or failure to clear the DTC in this step will lead to incorrect diagnosis, trouble diagnosis of a normal circuit or difficulty in troubleshooting.

 and 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0A1114001003">Step 2: DTC &#x002F; Freeze Frame Data Check, Record and Clearance</intxref>

 first. When the end of the flow has been reached, check the parts of the system suspected as a possible cause referring to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0A1114010">Engine Symptom Diagnosis:For Petrol Engine Model</intxref>
 and based on symptoms appearing on the vehicle (symptoms obtained through steps of customer complaint analysis, trouble symptom confirmation and&#x002F;or basic engine check) and repair or replace faulty parts, if any.

Step 9: Troubleshooting for DTC (See each DTC Diag. Flow)
</title>

<servinfosub id = "S6JB0A1114001010" page = "2">
<title>
Step 11: Final Confirmation Test
</title>
<ptxt>
Confirm that the problem symptom has gone and the engine is free from any abnormal conditions. If what has been repaired is related to the DTC, clear the DTC once, perform DTC confirmation procedure and confirm that no DTC is indicated.
