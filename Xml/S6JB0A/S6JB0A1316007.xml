Check accelerator pedal position (APP) sensor (main and sub) output voltage as following steps.
</ptxt>
<s1 page = "2">
<ptxt>
For accelerator pedal position (APP) sensor (main), arrange 3 new 1.5 V batteries (1) in series (check that total voltage is 4.7 &#8211; 5.0 V) and connect its positive terminal to &#8220;Vin 1&#8221; terminal (2) and negative terminal to &#8220;Ground 1&#8221; terminal (3) of sensor. Then using voltmeter, connect positive terminal to &#8220;Vout 1&#8221; terminal (4) of sensor and negative terminal to battery.
