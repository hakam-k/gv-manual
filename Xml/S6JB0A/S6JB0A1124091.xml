Either using an ammeter:
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
With the regulator connected, connect the amperometric clamp to the connection to the fuel flow actuator &#8220;C83-1&#8221; terminal connection, observing the current direction. Clear any fuel pressure sensor faults and perform output test &#8220;IMV&#x002F;Flow actuator&#8221; on SUZUKI scan tool.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The ammeter should display five cycles of two successive strengths: ~ 0.6 A then ~ 2 A
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Or using a voltmeter:
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
With the fuel flow actuator connected, connect the negative terminal of the voltmeter to &#8220;C83-2&#8221; wire of the fuel flow actuator connector and the positive terminal to &#8220;C83-1&#8221; wire. Clear any fuel flow actuator faults, then perform &#8220;IMV&#x002F;Flow actuator&#8221; on SUZUKI scan tool:
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The voltmeter should display two successive voltage readings:
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
~ 3.15 volts for an opening cyclic ratio of 25&#x0025; then ~ 9.45 V for an opening cyclic ratio of 75&#x0025; (five cycles)
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Or using an oscilloscope (at 5 V range&#x002F;division and 1 ms&#x002F;div time base):
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
With the fuel flow actuator connected, connect the negative terminal of the oscilloscope to the ground terminal at battery and the positive terminal to &#8220;C83-2&#8221; wire of the fuel flow actuator connector, clear any fuel flow actuator faults, then perform &#8220;IMV&#x002F;Flow actuator&#8221; on SUZUKI scan tool:
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The oscilloscope should display a square-wave signal of an amplitude of 12.5 V at a frequency of 185 Hz (with an opening cyclic ratio alternating from 25 to 75&#x0025;).
</ptxt>
</item>
