On-Board Diagnostic System Description

For E-OBD Model

<ptxt>
For automatic transmission control system, TCM has the following functions. Refer to

When the ignition switch is turned ON with the engine at a stop, malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) (1) turns ON to check the bulb of the MIL.

<ptxt>
When TCM detects a malfunction in A&#x002F;T control system TCM desires turning on malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) and stores malfunction DTC in TCM memory.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
(If it detects that continuously 3 driving cycles are normal after detecting a malfunction, however, it makes MIL turn OFF although DTC stored in its memory will remain.)

It is possible to communicate through DLC (3) by using not only SUZUKI scan tool (2) but also OBD generic scan tool. (Diagnostic information can be checked and erased by using a scan tool.)

2 Driving cycle detection logic
</title>
<ptxt>
The malfunction detected in the first driving cycle is stored in TCM memory (in the form of pending DTC and freeze frame data) but the malfunction indicator lamp does not light at this time. It lights up at the second detection of same malfunction also in the next driving cycle.

Pending DTC
</title>
<ptxt>
Pending DTC means a DTC detected and stored temporarily at 1 driving cycle of the DTC which is detected in the 2 driving cycle detection logic.

<topic id = "S6JB0A5101008004">
<title>
Freeze frame data
</title>
<ptxt>
TCM stores the engine and driving conditions at the moment of the detection of a malfunction in its memory. This data is called &#8220;Freeze frame data&#8221;.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Therefore, it is possible to know engine and driving conditions (e.g., whether the engine was warm or not, where the vehicle was running or stopped) when a malfunction was detected by checking the freeze frame data.
