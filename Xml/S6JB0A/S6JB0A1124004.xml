Step 2: Visual Inspection
</title>
<ptxt>
As a preliminary step, be sure to perform visual check of the items that support proper function of the engine referring to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0A1124009">Visual Inspection:For Diesel Engine Model</intxref>
.
</ptxt>
</servinfosub>
<servinfosub id = "S6JB0A1124004004" page = "2">
<title>
Step 3: DTC Check, Record and Clearance
</title>
<ptxt>
First, check DTC, referring to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0A1124005">DTC Check:For Diesel Engine Model</intxref>
. If DTC is indicated, record and clear DTC by referring to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0A1124006">DTC Clearance:For Diesel Engine Model</intxref>
. 
</ptxt>

<title>
Step 4: Engine Basic Inspection and Fault Finding-Customer Complaints
</title>
<ptxt>
Perform basic engine check according to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0A1124010">Engine Basic Inspection:For Diesel Engine Model</intxref>
 first. When the end of the flow table has been reached, check the parts of the system suspected as a possible cause referring to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0A1124153">Fault Finding-Customer Complaints:For Diesel Engine Model</intxref>
 and based on symptoms appearing on the vehicle (symptoms obtained through steps of customer complaint analysis, trouble symptom confirmation and&#x002F;or basic engine check) and repair or replace faulty parts, if any.

</servinfosub>
<servinfosub id = "S6JB0A1124004008" page = "2">
<title>
Step 7: Intermittent Problems Check
</title>
<ptxt>
Check parts where an intermittent trouble is easy to occur (e.g., wire harness, connector, etc.), referring to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0A0006002">Intermittent and Poor Connection Inspection</intxref>
 and related circuit of DTC recorded in Step 2.

</servinfosub>
<servinfosub id = "S6JB0A1124004009" page = "2">
<title>
Step 8: Final Confirmation Test
</title>
<ptxt>
Confirm that the problem symptom has gone and the engine is free from any abnormal conditions. If what has been repaired is related to the DTC, clear the DTC once and then recheck DTC and confirm that no DTC is indicated.
