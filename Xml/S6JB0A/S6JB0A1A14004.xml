Generator Test (Overcharged Battery Check)
</title>
<s1>
<ptxt>
To determine battery condition, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0A1A11001">Battery Description:For Petrol Engine Model</intxref>
.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
If obvious overcharge condition exists as evidenced by excessive spewing of electrolyte, measure generator &#8220;B&#8221; terminal voltage at engine 2000 rpm.

If measured voltage is higher than upper limit value, proceed to disassemble generator.

Check ground of brushes. If brushes are not grounded, replace IC regulator. Then check field coil for grounds and shorts, referring to
