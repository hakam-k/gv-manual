Test 6: Rotating part of a turbocharger
</title>
<diag type = "test" id = "S6JB0A1124171001">
<testgroup>
<ptxt>
With the engine cold and stopped, remove the air inlet duct from the turbocharger, check manually if the compressor and turbine shaft turns.
</ptxt>
<question>
Does the shaft turn?
</question>
<result>
YES

Go to Step 2.
</ptxt>

<result>
NO
</result>
<action>
<ptxt>
Replace the turbocharger. Seizing of the turbocharger could be caused by poor lubrication of the bearings. Check the lubrication circuit for any blockage and check the engine oil pressure. Perform an oil change and change the oil filter.

<ptxt>
Perform a visual inspection of the condition of the compressor and turbine wheels. (&#x005B;A&#x005D;: Deformed, twisted blade (&#8220;soft&#8221; foreign body), &#x005B;B&#x005D;: Broken blades (&#8220;hard&#8221; foreign body))

</testfigure>
<question>
The significant axial play is approximately 2 mm (0.080 in.). Does the turbo have too much play in the shaft?
</question>
<result>
YES

<ptxt>
Replace the turbocharger. If the rotating part is broken:
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
change the engine oil and the oil filter.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
clean the intercooler and the air circuit ducts.
