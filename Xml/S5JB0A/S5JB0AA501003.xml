Keyless Engine Start Function
</title>
<ptxt>
When the ignition knob switch (2) installed to the steering lock unit (1) is pushed, the keyless start control module (3) activates the center antenna (4) to send out the request signal in the vehicle compartment. When the remote controller (5) receives the request signal from the center antenna, it transmits the ID code to the keyless start control module. The keyless start control module compares the ID code sent by the remote controller with the ID code registered in the keyless start control module. When these ID codes match, the keyless start control module makes the key indicator lamp (7) in the combination meter (6) light in blue and unlocks the steering lock unit to enable the ignition knob switch to turn. When the ignition knob switch is turned to ON position in this state, ID codes of ECM and keyless start control module are compared through CAN communication (immobilizer function).

<ptxt>
When they match, turning the ignition knob switch to start position will start the engine.

When the ID code from the remote controller and the ID code registered in the keyless start control module do not match or when the remote controller is outside the operation area of the remote controller and the ignition knob switch is pushed, the steering lock unit cannot be unlocked and so the ignition knob switch cannot be turned. Then, the keyless start control module makes the key indicator lamp in the combination meter light in red to warn the driver that it is not possible to turn the ignition knob switch. Also, when the ID code of ECM and that of the keyless start control module do not match, the engine cannot be started even if the ignition knob switch is turned to the start position. Then ECM makes the immobilizer lamp in the combination meter flash to warn the driver that it is not possible to start the engine.
