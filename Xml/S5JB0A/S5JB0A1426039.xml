Two kinds of connecting rod bearings are available; standard size bearing and 0.25 mm (0.0098 in.) undersize bearing. For identification of undersize bearing, it is painted red (1) at the position as indicated in the figure, undersize bearing thickness is 1.605 &#8211; 1.615 mm (0.0632 &#8211; 0.0635 in.) at the center of it.

From number stamped on connecting rod and its cap and alphabet stamped on crank web No. 3 cylinder, determine new standard bearing to be installed to connecting rod big-end inside, by referring to the table.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
For example, if number stamped on connecting rod and its cap is &#8220;1&#8221; and alphabet stamped on crank web No. 3 cylinder is &#8220;B&#8221;, install a new standard bearing painted in &#8220;Black&#8221; to its connecting rod big-end inside.
