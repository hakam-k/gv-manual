Remove bearing caps and using scale (1) on gauging plastic envelop (2), measure gauging plastic width at its widest point. If clearance exceeds its limit, replace bearing. Always replace both upper and lower inserts as a unit.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
A new standard bearing may produce proper clearance. If not, it will be necessary to regrind crankshaft journal for use of 0.25 mm undersize bearing.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
After selecting new bearing, recheck clearance.
