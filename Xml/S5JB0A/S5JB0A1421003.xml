IMT (Intake manifold tuning) system consists of the following items:
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
IMT valve (5) fixed on intake manifold (1)
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>

IMT valve actuator (4)

IMT vacuum solenoid valve (2)
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Vacuum tank (3)
</ptxt>
</item>
</list1>
<p-change/>
<ptxt>
Vacuum tank contains the one way check valve (6) to maintain negative pressure constantly regardless of variation in the intake manifold pressure.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Vacuum tank, therefore, supplies IMT vacuum solenoid valve actuator with stable negative pressure in whole engine speed ranges.

IMT (Intake manifold tuning) system varies effective length of intake pipe by opening and closing IMT valve in order to improve air volumetric efficiency.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
As intake valve in cylinder head is opened and closed repeatedly, intake air pulsation always exists. If intake valve is opened when air pressure is momentarily maximum, intake air volumetric efficiency is increased. This momentary maximum air pressure depends on effective intake pipe length.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When IMT valve is fully open &#x005B;A&#x005D;:
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The effective intake pipe length is shorter. Engine torque between middle and high engine speed ranges is improved, whilst it drops between low and middle engine speed ranges.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When IMT valve is totally closed &#x005B;B&#x005D;:
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The effective intake pipe length is longer. Engine torque between middle and high engine speed ranges drops, while it is improved between low and middle ranges.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
IMT system utilizes this characteristic of engine. IMT valve is closed between low and middle engine speed ranges, and opened between middle and high engine speed ranges.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
In this way, engine torque is improved in whole engine speed ranges.

System Operation
</title>
<ptxt>
IMT vacuum solenoid valve open:
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When IMT vacuum solenoid valve is OFF, the actuator side of IMT vacuum solenoid valve is lead to relief port. Under this condition, the negative pressure is not applied to IMT valve actuator. The IMT valve, therefore, is totally opened due to the force of return spring in IMT valve actuator.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The effective intake pipe length, therefore, becomes shorter.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
IMT valve closed:
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When IMT vacuum solenoid valve is ON, the actuator side of IMT vacuum solenoid valve is lead to vacuum tank. Under this condition, the negative pressure of vacuum tank is applied to IMT valve actuator. The IMT valve, therefore, is totally closed because the return spring in IMT valve actuator is compressed due to the negative pressure.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The effective intake pipe length, therefore, becomes longer.
