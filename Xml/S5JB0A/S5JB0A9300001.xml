</title>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Combination meter uses signals (information) from each control module by CAN communication to control speedometer, tachometer, fuel meter, engine coolant temp meter, warning light and indicator light (other than air bag warning light, headlight leveling warning light, rear fog light and turn signal indicator lamp). Therefore, check that no DTC is detected in each module before performing combination meter symptom diagnosis. If any DTC is detected, correct trouble indicated by that DTC troubleshooting first.
