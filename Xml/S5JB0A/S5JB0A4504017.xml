DTC Detecting Condition
</title>
<ptxt>
ABS control module monitors the voltage at the terminal of solenoid circuit constantly with ignition switch turned ON. Also, immediately after ignition switch is turned ON, perform initial check as follows.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Switch solenoid valve power supply driver (transistor) in the order of OFF &#8594; ON and check if voltage changes to Low &#8594; High. If anything faulty is found in the initial check and when the voltage is low with ignition switch turned ON, this DTC will be set.
