<ptxt>
For installation, reverse removal procedure, noting the following.
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Wheel nuts must be tightened in sequence and to proper torque to avoid bending wheel or brake drum or brake disc as shown in the figure.
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
Before installing wheels, remove any build-up of corrosion on wheel mounting surface and brake disc mounting surface by scraping and wire brushing. Installing wheels without good metal-to-metal contact at mounting surfaces can cause wheel nuts to loosen, which can later allow a wheel to come off while vehicle is moving.
