Automatic Transmission Description
</title>
<ptxt>
This automatic transmission is a full automatic type with 3-speed plus overdrive (O&#x002F;D).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The torque converter is a 3-element, 1-step and 2-phase type and is equipped with an electronically controlled lock-up mechanism. The gear shift device consists of 3 sets of planetary gear units,3 disc type clutches, 4 disc type brakes and 3 one-way clutches. The gear shift is done by selecting one of 7 positions (&#8220;P&#8221;, &#8220;R&#8221;, &#8220;N&#8221;, &#8220;D&#8221;, &#8220;3&#8221;, &#8220;2&#8221; and &#8220;L&#8221;) by means of the select lever installed on the floor. Also, by using the P&#x002F;N mode switch located on the console box, it is possible to select the gear change timing of 2 modes, normal and power.
