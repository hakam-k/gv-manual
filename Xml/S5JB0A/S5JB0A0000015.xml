<attention2>
<ptxt>
The air conditioning system of this vehicle uses refrigerant HFC-134a (R-134a).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
None of refrigerant, compressor oil and component parts is interchangeable between two types of A&#x002F;C: one using refrigerant CFC-12 (R-12) and the other using refrigerant HFC-134a (R-134a).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Be sure to check which refrigerant is used before any service work including inspection and maintenance. For identification between these two types, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S5JB0A7201001">A&#x002F;C Refrigerant Type Description</intxref>
.

When replenishing or changing refrigerant and compressor oil and when replacing parts, make sure that the material or the part to be used is appropriate to the A&#x002F;C installed in the vehicle being serviced.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
