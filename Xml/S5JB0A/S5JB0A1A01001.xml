Battery Description
</title>
<ptxt>
The battery has three major functions in the electrical system.
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
It is a source of electrical energy for cranking the engine.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
It acts as a voltage stabilizer for the electrical system.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
It can, for a limited time, provide energy when the electrical load exceeds the output of the generator.
</ptxt>
</item>
</list1>

<title>
Carrier and Hold-Down
</title>
<ptxt>
The battery carrier should be in good condition so that it will support the battery securely and keep it level.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Before installing the battery, the battery carrier and hold-down clamp should be clean and free from corrosion and make certain there are no parts in carrier.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
To prevent the battery from shaking in its carrier, the hold-down bolts should be tight enough but not over-tightened.
</ptxt>
</servinfosub>
<servinfosub id = "S5JB0A1A01001002">
<title>
Electrolyte Freezing
</title>
<ptxt>
The freezing point of electrolyte depends on its specific gravity. Since freezing may ruin a battery, it should be protected against freezing by keeping it in a fully charged condition. If a battery is frozen accidentally, it should not be charged until it is warmed.
</ptxt>
</servinfosub>
<servinfosub id = "S5JB0A1A01001003">
<title>
Sulfation
</title>
<ptxt>
If the battery is allowed to stand for a long period in discharged condition, the lead sulfate becomes converted into a hard, crystalline substance, which will not easily turn back to the active material again during the subsequent recharging. &#8220;Sulfation&#8221; means the result as well as the process of that reaction.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Such a battery can be revived by very slow charging and may be restored to usable condition but its capacity is lower than before.
</ptxt>
</servinfosub>
<servinfosub id = "S5JB0A1A01001004">
<title>
Built-in Indicator (if equipped)
</title>
<ptxt>
The battery has a built-in temperature compensated indicator (1) in the top of the battery. This indicator is to be used with the following diagnostic procedure. 
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When checking the indicator, make sure that the battery has a clean top. A light may be needed in some poorly-lit areas.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Three types of indication available under normal operation are as follows.

<emph etype = "bold">
Green Dot:
</emph>
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Battery is sufficiently charged for testing.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
<emph etype = "bold">
Dark:
</emph>
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Battery must be charged before testing.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If there is a cranking complaint, battery should be tested as described in 
<intxref refid = "S5JB0A1A04004">Battery Inspection</intxref>
.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Charging and electrical systems should also be checked at this time.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
<emph etype = "bold">
Clear or Light Yellow:
</emph>
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
This means that fluid level is below the bottom of hydrometer. Its possible cause is excessive or prolonged charging, a broken case, excessive tipping or normal battery deterioration.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When the battery is found in such condition, it is possible that high charging voltage is caused by the faulty charging system and therefore, charging and electrical systems need to be checked. If there is a trouble in cranking and its cause lies in the battery, it should be replaced.
