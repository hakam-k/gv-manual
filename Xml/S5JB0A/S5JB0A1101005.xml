CAN Communication System Description
</title>
<ptxt>
ECM (1), ABS hydraulic unit &#x002F; control module assembly (2), TCM (for A&#x002F;T model) (3), BCM (4), 4WD control module (for J20 engine) (5), combination meter (6) and keyless start control module (if equipped) (7) of this vehicle communicate control data between each control module.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Communication of each control module is established by CAN (Controller Area Network) communication system.

CAN communication system uses the serial communication in which data is transmitted at a high speed. It uses a twisted pair of two communication lines for the high-speed data transmission. As one of its characteristics, multiple control modules can communicate simultaneously. In addition, it has a function to detect a communication error automatically. Each module reads necessary data from the received data and transmits data. ECM communicates control data with each control module as follows.

In communication between ECM and combination meter, between ECM and keyless start control module (if equipped) and between ECM and 4WD control module (for J20 engine), data is transmitted only from ECM to combination meter, keyless start control module (if equipped) and 4WD control module (for J20 engine). (Combination meter, keyless start control module (if equipped) and 4WD control module (for J20 engine) does not transmit data to ECM.)
