Valve stem-to-guide clearance
</title>
<ptxt>
Using a micrometer and bore gauge, take diameter readings on valve stems and guides to check stem-to-guide clearance.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Be sure to take reading at more than one place along the length of each stem and guide.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If clearance exceeds limit, replace valve and valve guide.
