General Service Procedure Information
</title>
<ptxt>
When repairing automatic transmission, it is necessary to conduct the on-vehicle test to investigate where the cause of the trouble lies first.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Then whether overhaul should be done or not is determined. If the transmission is disassembled without such preliminary procedure, not only the cause of the trouble would be unknown, but also a secondary trouble may occur and often time would be wasted.
