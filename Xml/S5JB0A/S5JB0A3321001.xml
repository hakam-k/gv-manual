Transfer Construction
</title>
<ptxt>
The aluminum transfer case directly connected to the back of the transmission contains the input gear, rear output shaft, front output shaft and drive chain.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The transfer has an oil pump to provide proper lubrication even under the strict condition of use.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The center differential is installed in the transfer. With the torque induction type LSD used in the center differential, the effect of LSD works when a rotation difference between front and rear wheels.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The differential lock lever is installed in shaft case. Center differential can be locked by operating differential lock lever, if necessary.
