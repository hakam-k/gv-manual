Oil Pressure Check
</title>
<attention1>
<ptxt>
To avoid danger of being burned, do not touch exhaust manifold when exhaust system is hot.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When servicing, be sure to perform it after exhaust system has cooled down.
</ptxt>
</attention1>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
Prior to checking oil pressure, check the following.
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Oil level in oil pan
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If oil level is low, add oil up to Full level hole on oil level gauge referring to 
<intxref refid = "S5JB0A0206003">Engine Oil and Filter Change</intxref>
.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Oil quality
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If oil is discolored, or deteriorated, change it. For particular oil to be used, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S5JB0A0206003">Engine Oil and Filter Change</intxref>
.

Be sure to place transmission gear shift lever in &#8220;Neutral&#8221; (shift selector lever to &#8220;P&#8221; range for A&#x002F;T model), and set parking brake and block drive wheels.
</ptxt>
