Fuel Delivery System Description
</title>
<ptxt>
The fuel delivery system consists of the fuel tank, fuel pump assembly (with built-in fuel filter), fuel pressure regulator, delivery pipe, injectors, fuel return line, fuel vapor line and fuel feed line.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The fuel in the fuel tank is pumped up by the fuel pump, sent into delivery pipe and injected by the injectors.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
As the fuel pump assembly is equipped with built-in fuel filter, the fuel is filtered and its pressure is regulated after being sent to the feed pipe.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The excess fuel at fuel pressure regulation process is returned back into the fuel tank.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Also, fuel vapor generated in fuel tank is led through the fuel vapor line into the EVAP canister.
</ptxt>
