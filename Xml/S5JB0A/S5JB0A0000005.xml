Precaution for CAN Communication System

<ptxt>
The loose (1) in the wire harnesses twist of the CAN lines except around the connector (3) should be within 100 mm (3.9 in.). Refer to the wiring diagram for the CAN lines discrimination. Excessively-loosed lines may be influenced by the electric noise.

Do not connect terminals of the CAN line using a bypass wire (1). Otherwise, the CAN line may be influenced by the electric noise.
