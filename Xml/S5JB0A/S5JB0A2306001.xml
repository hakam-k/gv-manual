Rear Wheel Alignment Inspection and Adjustment
</title>
<ptxt>
Among factors for rear wheel alignment, only toe and camber setting can be adjusted.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Caster can&#8217;t be adjusted. Therefore, should caster be out of specification due to the damage caused by hazardous road conditions or collision, whether the damage is in body or in suspension should be determined and damaged body should be repaired or damaged suspension should be replaced.
