If ESP&#174; OFF switch is turned &#8220;ON&#8221;, the ESP&#174; OFF light light up. When it is &#8220;ON&#8221;, TCS and stability control system functions are controlled not to work. However, when the speed is over 30 km&#x002F;h (18.5 mph), ESP&#174; OFF light is turned &#8220;OFF&#8221; and TCS and stability control system function is back to work automatically.
