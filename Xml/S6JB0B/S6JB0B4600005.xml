Precautions in Speedometer Test or Other Tests
</title>
<ptxt>
When performing speedometer or a bench test while rotating a tire, ESP&#174; function must be kept at stop. It is possible to stop ESP&#174; function temporarily by ESP&#174; OFF switch. In this case, however, the function is forced to come back to work when the speed exceeds 30km&#x002F;h (18.5 mph) and may hinder accurate testing.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
There are two ways to stop the ESP&#174; function completely as described bellow.

Connect the SUZUKI scan tool, set to the &#8220;MISC. TEST&#8221; mode to stop the ESP&#174; function. Refer to SUZUKI scan tool operator&#8217;s manual for further details.

Disconnect the connector of the steering angle sensor, and ESP&#174; function is forced to enter the fail-safe mode, then ESP&#174; function is stopped.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
However, when this method is used, DTC remains in the memory of the ESP&#174; control module. Therefore, after the test, re-connect the connector, clear DTC in the memory of the ESP&#174; control module. And calibrate steering angle sensor referring to &#8220;Sensor Calibration&#8221;.
