DTC Confirmation Procedure
</title>
<s1>
<ptxt>
With ignition switch turned OFF, connect scan tool.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Turn ON ignition switch and clear DTC using scan tool.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Start engine and warm up to normal operating temperature.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Drive vehicle at 40 mph (60 km&#x002F;h) or higher. (engine speed: 2500 &#8211; 3000 r&#x002F;min.)
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Keep above vehicle speed for 4 min. or more. (Throttle valve opening is kept constant in this step.)
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Check if DTC and pending DTC exist by using scan tool. If not, check if oxygen sensor monitoring test has been completed by using scan tool. If not in both of above checks (i.e., no DTC and pending DTC and oxygen sensor monitoring test not completed), check vehicle condition (environmental) and repeat Step 3) through 6).
