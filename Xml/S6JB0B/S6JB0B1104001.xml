<title>
Step 1: Customer complaint analysis
</title>
<ptxt>
Record details of the problem (failure, complaint) and how it occurred as described by the customer. For this purpose, use of such an inspection form will facilitate collecting information to the point required for proper analysis and diagnosis.
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
The form is standard sample. It should be modified according to conditions and characteristics of each market.

<title>
Step 2: DTC &#x002F; freeze frame data check, record and clearance
</title>
<ptxt>
First, check DTC (including pending DTC), referring to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0B1104007">DTC Check</intxref>
. If DTC is indicated, record DTC and freeze frame data. After that clear DTC referring to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0B1104008">DTC Clearance</intxref>
. DTC indicates malfunction that occurred in the system but does not indicate whether it exists now or it occurred in the past and the normal condition has been restored now. To check which case applies, check the symptom in question according to Step 5 and recheck DTC according to Step 6 and 7.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Attempt to diagnose a trouble based on DTC in this step only or failure to clear the DTC (including pending DTC) in this step will lead to incorrect diagnosis, trouble diagnosis of a normal circuit or difficulty in troubleshooting.

Step 8: Engine basic inspection and engine symptom diagnosis
</title>
<ptxt>
Perform basic engine check according to the 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0B1104003">Engine Basic Check</intxref>
 first. When the end of the flow has been reached, check the parts of the system suspected as a possible cause referring to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0B1104011">Engine Symptom Diagnosis</intxref>

<topic id = "S6JB0B1104001009">
<title>
Step 9: DTC troubleshooting
</title>
<ptxt>
Based on the DTC indicated in Step 6 or 7 and referring to the applicable DTC diag. flow, locate the cause of the trouble, namely in a sensor, switch, wire harness, connector, actuator, ECM or other part and repair or replace faulty parts.
</ptxt>
</topic>
<topic id = "S6JB0B1104001010">
<title>
Step 10: Intermittent problems check
</title>
<ptxt>
Check parts where an intermittent trouble is easy to occur (e.g., wire harness, connector, etc.), referring to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0B0006002">Intermittent and Poor Connection Inspection</intxref>

Step 11: Final confirmation test
</title>
<ptxt>
Confirm that the problem symptom has gone and the engine is free from any abnormal conditions. If what has been repaired is related to the DTC, clear the DTC once, perform DTC confirmation procedure and confirm that no malfunction DTC (a normal code) is indicated.
