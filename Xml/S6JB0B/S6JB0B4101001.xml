Brakes Construction
</title>
<ptxt>
When the foot brake pedal is depressed, hydraulic pressure is developed in the master cylinder (2) to actuate pistons (two in front and four in rear).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The master cylinder is a tandem master cylinder. Brake pipes are connected to the master cylinder and they make two independent circuits. One connects front right and rear left brakes and the other connects front left and rear right brakes.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
In this brake system, the disc brake type is used for the front wheel brake and a drum brake type (leading &#x002F; trailing shoes) for the rear brake.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The parking brake system is mechanical. It applies brake force to only rear wheels by means of the cable and mechanical linkage system. The same brake shoes are used for both parking and foot brakes.
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
The difference between RHD model and LHD model is the location of the brake master and the brake booster only.
