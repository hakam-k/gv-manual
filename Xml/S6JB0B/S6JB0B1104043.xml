System Description
</title>
<ptxt>
EGR system consists of EGR valve and its passage. ECM judges EGR valve opening based on the following items. (engine speed, engine load, engine coolant temperature, intake air temperature and vehicle speed)
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If EGR system is in good condition, intake manifold absolute pressure is varied within specified value as soon as ECM opens EGR valve.
