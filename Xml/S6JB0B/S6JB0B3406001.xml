Propeller Shaft Joint Check
</title>
<ptxt>
If universal joints and ball joints are suspected of producing chattering or rattling noise, inspect them for wear. For universal joint, check to see if cross spider rattles in yokes or if splines are worn down and replace defective propeller shaft assembly with new one.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Noise coming from universal joint and ball joint can be easily distinguished from other noises because rhythm of chattering or rattling is in step with cruising speed. Noise is pronounced particularly on standing start or in coasting condition (when braking effect of engine is showing in the drive line).
