Inspection of Headlight Leveling Control Module and Its Circuit (Vehicle Equipped with Auto Leveling Headlight System)
</title>
<ptxt>
Headlight auto leveling control module and its circuits can be checked at headlight auto leveling control module wiring couplers by measuring voltage and pulse signal.
</ptxt>
<attention2>
<ptxt>
Headlight auto leveling control module cannot be checked by itself. It is strictly prohibited to connect voltmeter or ohmmeter to headlight auto leveling control module with couplers disconnected from it.
</ptxt>

<title>
Voltage Check
</title>
<ptxt>
Check voltage between each terminal of headlight auto leveling control module and vehicle body ground under each condition. If measured voltage is out of standard value, check circuit (including switch and sensor) of terminal where voltage was measured.
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
As each terminal voltage is affected by the battery voltage, confirm that it is 11 V or more when ignition switch is ON.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Voltage with asterisk (&#x002A;) cannot be measured by voltmeter because it is pulse signal. Check it with oscilloscope if necessary.
