IMT (Intake Manifold Tuning) System Description
</title>
<ptxt>
IMT system consists of the following items:
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
IMT valve (1) installed between intake manifold and surge tank pipe
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
IMT valve actuator (4)
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
IMT vacuum solenoid valve (2)
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Vacuum tank (3)
</ptxt>
</item>
</list1>
<ptxt>
Vacuum tank contains the one way check valve (5) to maintain negative pressure constantly regardless of variation in the intake manifold pressure.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Vacuum tank, therefore, supplies IMT vacuum solenoid valve actuator with stable negative pressure in whole engine speed ranges.

<ptxt>
IMT system varies the effective length of intake pipe by opening and closing IMT valve in order to improve an air volumetric efficiency.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When IMT valve is fully open &#x005B;A&#x005D;:
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The effective length of intake pipe is short. 
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
With this condition, the engine torque is large at low and middle-high engine speed ranges. 
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
However, the engine torque is small at middle-low and high engine speed ranges.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When IMT valve is totally closed &#x005B;B&#x005D;:
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The effective length of intake pipe is long. 
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
With this condition, the engine torque is large at middle-low and high engine speed ranges. 
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
However, the engine torque is small at low and middle-high engine speed ranges.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
IMT system utilizes this characteristic of engine. IMT valve is opened at low and middle-high engine speed ranges, and closed at middle-low and high engine speed ranges. 
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
In this way, engine torque is improved in whole engine speed ranges.
