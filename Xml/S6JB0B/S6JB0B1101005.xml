Air Intake System Description
</title>
<ptxt>
The main components of the air intake system are air cleaner, air cleaner outlet hose, electric throttle body (for the details, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0B1101006">Electric Throttle Body System Description</intxref>
.), IMT valve which adjusts the distributor pipe length of intake manifold (for the details, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0B1401003">IMT (Intake Manifold Tuning) System Description</intxref>
.) and intake manifold.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The air (by the amount corresponding to throttle valve opening and engine speed) is filtered by the air cleaner, distributed by the intake manifold, and finally drawn into each combustion chamber. Electric throttle body is not equipped with IAC valve for idle speed control. Idle speed control is done by the throttle actuator which opens &#x002F; closes the throttle valve. (For the details, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0B1101006">Electric Throttle Body System Description</intxref>
.)
