Main Bearing General Information
</title>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
Before inspecting main bearings, note the following points.
</ptxt>
</attention3>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Service main bearings are available in standard size and 0.25 mm (0.0098 in.) undersize, and each of them has 5 kinds of bearings differing in tolerance.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Upper half of bearing (1) has oil groove (2) as shown in figure. Install this half with oil groove toward cylinder block.
</ptxt>

<title>
Visual Inspection
</title>
<ptxt>
Check bearings for pitting, scratches, wear or damage.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If any malcondition is found, replace both upper and lower halves. Never replace either half without replacing the other half.

Main Bearing Clearance
</title>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
Do not rotate crankshaft while gauging plastic is installed.
</ptxt>
</attention3>
<ptxt>
Check clearance by using gauging plastic (1) according to the following procedure.
</ptxt>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Remove lower crankcase.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Clean bearings and main journals.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Place a piece of gauging plastic (1) to full width of bearing (parallel to crankshaft) on journal, avoiding oil hole.
</ptxt>
<figure>
<graphic graphicname = "IYSQ01143163.swf" width = "88.000mm" height = "47.021mm" ver = "01" gw = "152" gh = "116"/>
</figure>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Install lower crankcase to cylinder block without applying sealant referring to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0B1406044">Main Bearings, Crankshaft and Cylinder Block Removal and Installation</intxref>
.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Remove lower crankcase, and using scale (2) on gauging plastic (1) envelop, measure gauging plastic (1) width at its widest point. If clearance exceeds its limit, replace bearing. Always replace both upper and lower inserts as a unit.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
A new standard bearing may produce proper clearance. If not, it will be necessary to regrind crankshaft journal for use of 0.25 mm undersize bearing.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
After selecting new bearing, recheck clearance.
