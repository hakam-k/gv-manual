All steering gear fasteners are important attaching parts in that they could affect the performance of vital parts and systems, and&#x002F;or could result in major repair expense. They must be replaced with one of the same part number or with an equivalent part if replacement becomes necessary. Do not use a replacement part of lesser quality or substitute design. Torque values must be used as specified during reassembly to assure proper retention of these parts.
