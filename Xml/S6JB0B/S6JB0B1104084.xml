Inspection of ECM and Its Circuits
</title>
<ptxt>
ECM and its circuits can be checked by measuring voltage, pulse signal and resistance with special tool connected.
</ptxt>
<attention2>
<ptxt>
ECM cannot be checked by itself. It is strictly prohibited to connect voltmeter or ohmmeter to ECM with ECM connectors disconnected from it.

Remove ECM (1) from its bracket referring to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0B1306001">Engine Control Module (ECM) Removal and Installation</intxref>
.
</ptxt>

<ptxt>
Check voltage and&#x002F;or pulse signal using voltmeter (2) and oscilloscope (3).
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
As each terminal voltage is affected by battery voltage, confirm that it is 11 V or more when ignition switch is turned ON.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Voltage with asterisk (&#x002A;) cannot be measured with voltmeter because it is pulse signal. Use oscilloscope for its check if necessary.
