Inspect crank pin for uneven wear or damage. Measure crank pin for out-of-round or taper with a micrometer. If crank pin is damaged, or out-of-round or taper is out of limit, replace crankshaft or regrind crank pin then inspect rod bearing clearance referring to &#8220;Connecting rod bearing clearance&#8221;.
