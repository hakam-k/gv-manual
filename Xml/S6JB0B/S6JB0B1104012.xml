Circuit Description
</title>
<ptxt>
When the ignition switch is turned ON, ECM causes the main relay to turn ON (close the contact point). Then, ECM being supplied with the main power, transmits indication ON signal of malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) to combination meter in order to turn MIL ON. And then, combination meter turns MIL ON. When the engine starts to run and no malfunction is detected in the system, ECM transmits MIL indication OFF signal to combination meter in order to turn MIL OFF. And then, combination meter turns MIL OFF, but if a malfunction was or is detected, MIL remains ON even when the engine is running.
