HVAC Control Module and Its Circuits Inspection
</title>
<attention2>
<ptxt>
HVAC control module can not be checked by itself.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
It is strictly prohibited to connect voltmeter to HVAC control module with couplers disconnected from it.
</ptxt>
</attention2>
<ptxt>
HVAC control module and its circuits can be checked at HVAC control module wiring couplers by measuring voltage.

Voltage Check
</title>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Remove HVAC control module. Refer to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0B7106011">HVAC Control Module Removal and Installation</intxref>
.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Connect HVAC control module and body control module couplers to HVAC control module and body control module.
</ptxt>
</s1>
