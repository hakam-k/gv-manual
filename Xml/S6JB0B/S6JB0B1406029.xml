Check clearance by using gauging plastic. The procedure is as follows.
</ptxt>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Clean housings and camshaft journals.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Make sure that all tappets and shims are removed and install camshafts to cylinder head.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Place a piece of gauging plastic the full width of journal of camshaft (parallel to camshaft).
</ptxt>

Tighten camshaft housing bolts in such order (&#8220;1&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;17&#8221;) as shown in figure a little at a time till they are tightened to specified torque.
</ptxt>
