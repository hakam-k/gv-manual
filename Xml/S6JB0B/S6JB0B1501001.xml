Engine Lubrication Description
</title>
<ptxt>
The oil pump is of a trochoid type, and mounted under the crankshaft. Oil is drawn up through the oil pump strainer and passed through the pump to the oil filter. The filtered oil flows into 3 paths in cylinder block.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
In one path, oil reaches the crankshaft main bearings. Oil from the crankshaft main bearings is supplied to the connecting rod bearings by means of intersecting passages drilled in the crankshaft, and then injected from the big end of connecting rod to lubricate piston, rings, and cylinder wall. In other paths oil goes up to the cylinder heads and lubricates valves and camshafts, etc., after passing through the internal oil way of camshafts. An oil relief valve is provided on the oil pump. This valve starts relieving oil pressure when the pressure exceeds the specified pressure.
