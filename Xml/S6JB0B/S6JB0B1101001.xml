Statement of Cleanliness and Care
</title>
<ptxt>
An automobile engine is a combination of many machined, honed, polished and lapped surfaces with tolerances that are measured in the thousands of an millimeter (ten thousands of inch). Accordingly, when any internal engine parts are serviced, care and cleanliness are important. Throughout this section, it should be understood that proper cleaning and protection of machined surfaces and friction areas is part of the repair procedure. This is considered standard shop practice even if not specifically stated.

Whenever valve train components, pistons, piston rings, connecting rods, rod bearings and crankshaft journal bearings are removed for service, they should be retained in order. At the time of installation, they should be installed in the same locations and with the same mating surfaces as when removed.
