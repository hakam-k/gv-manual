Fuel Pressure Inspection
</title>
<attention1>
<ptxt>
Before starting the following procedure, be sure to observe 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0B1700001">Precautions on Fuel System Service</intxref>
 in order to reduce the risk or fire and personal injury.
</ptxt>
</attention1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Relieve fuel pressure in fuel feed line referring to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0B1706003">Fuel Pressure Relief Procedure</intxref>
.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Disconnect fuel feed hose from fuel No.2 pipe.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Connect special tools and hose between fuel feed hose (1) and fuel No.2 pipe as shown in figure, and clamp hoses securely in order to ensure that no leaks occur during checking.

Check that battery voltage is 11 V or more.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Measure fuel pressure at each condition.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If measured pressure is out of specification, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0B1104088">Fuel Pressure Check</intxref>
 and check each possibly defective part. Replace if found defective.
</ptxt>
<s2>
<ptxt>
Turn ignition switch ON to operate fuel pump and after 2 seconds turn it OFF. Repeat this 3 or 4 times and then check fuel pressure.

After checking fuel pressure, remove fuel pressure gauge.
</ptxt>
<attention1>
<ptxt>
As fuel feed line is still under high fuel pressure, make sure to release fuel pressure according to the following procedures.
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Place fuel container under joint.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Cover joint with rag and loosen joint nut slowly in order to release fuel pressure gradually.
