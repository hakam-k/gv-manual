With ignition switch OFF, connect scan tool.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Turn ON ignition switch and clear DTC by using scan tool if any.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Start engine and warm up to normal operating temperature.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Increase vehicle speed till engine speed is reached 4000 rpm in 3rd gear (M&#x002F;T) or 2nd range (A&#x002F;T).
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Release accelerator pedal and with engine brake applied, keep vehicle coasting and then stop vehicle.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
