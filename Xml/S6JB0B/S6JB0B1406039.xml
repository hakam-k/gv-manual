2 sizes of piston are available as standard size spare part so as to ensure proper piston-to-cylinder clearance. When installing a standard size piston, make sure to match piston with cylinder as follows.
</ptxt>
<s2>
<ptxt>
Each piston (8) has stamped number (9) on its piston head. It represents outer diameter of piston.
</ptxt>
</s2>
<s2>
<ptxt>
There are also stamped numbers (10) or painted color (10) on cylinder block as shown in figure. 
</ptxt>
</s2>
<s2>
<ptxt>
Stamped number on piston and painted color (stamped number) on cylinder block must correspond. That is, install number &#8220;2&#8221; stamped piston to cylinder which is identified with blue painted (or &#8220;2&#8221; stamped) and a number &#8220;1&#8221; piston to cylinder with red painted (or &#8220;1&#8221; stamped).
