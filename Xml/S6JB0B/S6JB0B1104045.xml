System Description
</title>
<ptxt>
ECM monitors oxygen concentration in the exhaust gas which has passed the warm up three way catalytic converter by HO2S. When the catalyst is functioning properly, the variation cycle of HO2S output voltage (oxygen concentration) is slower than that of A&#x002F;F sensor output signal because the amount of oxygen in the exhaust gas is stored in warm up three way catalytic converter.
