Crankshaft Thrust Play
</title>
<ptxt>
Measure this play with crankshaft set in cylinder block in the normal manner, that is, with thrust bearing, lower crankcase, main bearings and main bearing caps installed. Refer to 
<intxref refid = "S6JB0B1406044">Main Bearings, Crankshaft and Cylinder Block Removal and Installation</intxref>
.

<ptxt>
Use a dial gauge to read displacement in axial (thrust) direction of crankshaft.

If its limit is exceeded, replace thrust bearing with new standard one or oversize one to obtain standard thrust play.

Out-of-Round and Taper (Uneven Wear) of Journals
</title>
<ptxt>
An unevenly worn crankshaft journal shows up as a difference in diameter at a cross section or along its length (or both). This difference, if any, is determined by taking micrometer readings. If any one of journals is badly damaged or if amount of uneven wear in the sense explained above exceeds its limit, regrind or replace crankshaft.
