Brake Fluid Level Check
</title>
<ptxt>
Be sure to use particular brake fluid either as indicated on reservoir cap of that vehicle or recommended in owner&#8217;s manual which comes along with that vehicle. 
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Use of any other fluid is strictly prohibited.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Fluid level should be between MIN and MAX lines marked on reservoir.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When warning light lights sometimes during driving, replenish fluid to MAX line.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When fluid decreases quickly, inspect brake system for leakage. Correct leaky points and then refill to specified level.
</ptxt>
<attention2>
<ptxt>
Do not use shock absorber fluid or any other fluid which contains mineral oil. Do not use a container which has been used for mineral oil or a container which is wet from water. Mineral oil will cause swelling and distortion of rubber parts in hydraulic brake system and water mixed into brake fluid will lower fluid boiling point. Keep all fluid containers capped to prevent contamination.
