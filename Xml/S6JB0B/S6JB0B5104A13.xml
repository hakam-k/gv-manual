Higher than standard level in both &#8220;D&#8221; and &#8220;R&#8221; range
</title>
<ptxt>
This test is to check overall performance of automatic transmission and engine by measuring stall speed at &#8220;D&#8221; and &#8220;R&#8221; ranges. Be sure to perform this test only when transmission fluid is at normal operating temperature and its level is between FULL and LOW marks.
</ptxt>
<attention2>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Do not run engine at stall more than 5 seconds continuously, for fluid temperature may rise excessively high.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
After performing stall test, be sure to leave engine running at idle for longer than 1 minute before another stall test.
</ptxt>
</item>

<ptxt>
Do not perform stall test at transfer position in 4L.
