Air Bleeding of Brake System
</title>
<attention2>
<ptxt>
Brake fluid is extremely damaging to paint. If fluid should accidentally touch painted surface, immediately wipe fluid from paint and clean painted surface.
</ptxt>
</attention2>
<ptxt>
Bleeding operation is necessary to remove air whenever it entered hydraulic rake system.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Hydraulic lines of brake system are based on the diagonal split system. When a brake pipe or hose was disconnected at the wheel, bleeding operation must be performed at both ends of the line of the removed pipe or hose. When any joint part of the master cylinder of other joint part between the master cylinder and each brake (wheel) was removed, the hydraulic brake system must be bled at all 4 wheel brakes.
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
Perform bleeding operation starting with wheel cylinder farthest from master cylinder and then at front caliper of the same brake line. Do the same on the other brake line.
</ptxt>
