ECM connectors are waterproofed. Each terminal of the ECM connectors is sealed up with the grommet. Therefore, do not measure circuit voltage and resistance by inserting the tester&#8217;s probe into the sealed terminal at the harness side. Or, ECM and its circuits may be damaged by water.

ECM (PCM) cannot be checked by itself.

It is strictly prohibited to connect voltmeter or ohmmeter to ECM (PCM) with couplers disconnected from it.
