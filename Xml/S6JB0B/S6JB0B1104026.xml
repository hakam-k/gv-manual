<item>
<ptxt>
When performing a road test, select a place where there is no traffic or possibility of a traffic accident and be very careful during testing to avoid occurrence of an accident.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Road test should be carried out by 2 persons, a driver and a tester, on a level road.
</ptxt>
</item>
</list1>

<attention3>
<ptxt>
Check to make sure that following conditions are satisfied when using this &#8220;DTC Confirmation Procedure&#8221;.
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Intake air temperature: &#8211;14 &#176;C (7 &#176;F) to 70 &#176;C (158 &#176;F).

With ignition switch turned OFF, connect scan tool.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Turn ON ignition switch and clear DTC using scan tool.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Start engine and warm up to normal operating temperature.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Drive vehicle at 40 mph (60 km&#x002F;h) or higher. (engine speed: 2500 &#8211; 3000 r&#x002F;min.)
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Keep above vehicle speed for 6 min. or more. (Throttle valve opening is kept constant in this step.)
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Release accelerator pedal and with engine brake applied, keep vehicle coasting (with fuel cut for 3 sec. or more) and then stop vehicle.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Check if DTC and pending DTC exist by using scan tool. If not, check if oxygen sensor monitoring test has been completed by using scan tool. If not in both of above checks (i.e., no DTC and pending DTC and oxygen sensor monitoring test not completed), check vehicle condition (environmental) and repeat Step 3) through 6).
