System Description
</title>
<ptxt>
ECM measure the angle of the crankshaft based on the pulse signal from the CKP sensor and CMP sensor for each cylinder. If it detects a large change in the angle speed of the crankshaft, it concludes occurrence of a misfire. When the number of misfire is counted by ECM beyond the DTC detecting condition, it determine the cylinder where the misfire occurred and output it as DTC.
