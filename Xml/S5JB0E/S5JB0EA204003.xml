Diagnosis Using Output Test Function of SUZUKI Scan Tool
</title>
<ptxt>
SUZUKI scan tool has the output test function which can force operation of following actuators and relays of the system controlled by BCM. When a malfunction is found in the system controlled by BCM, execute the output test which enables easy judgment whether the malfunction is on the input side or output side of BCM. For detailed information on operation of SUZUKI scan tool, refer to &#8220;SUZUKI Scan Tool Operator&#8217;s Manual&#8221;.
