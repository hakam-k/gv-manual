Inspection of 4WD Control Module and Its Circuits
</title>
<ptxt>
4WD control module and its circuits can be checked at coupler connected to 4WD control module by measuring voltage, pulse signal.
</ptxt>
<attention2>
<ptxt>
4WD control module cannot be checked by itself. It is strictly prohibited to connect voltmeter or ohmmeter to 4WD control module with couplers disconnected from it.

Voltage and Signal Check
</title>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Check voltage using voltmeter (1) connected to each terminal of couplers.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Check signal using oscilloscope (2) connected to each terminal of couplers.
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
As each terminal voltage is affected by the battery voltage, confirm that it is 11 V or more when ignition switch is turned ON.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Pulse signal cannot be measured by voltmeter. It can be measured by oscilloscope.

<ptxt>
Item with asterisk (&#x002A;) in normal voltage column can be read only by oscilloscope.
