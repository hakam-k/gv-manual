Stamped number on piston and painted color (or stamped number) on cylinder block should correspond. That is, install number &#8220;2&#8221; stamped piston to cylinder which is identified with blue painted (or &#8220;2&#8221; stamped) and a number &#8220;1&#8221; piston to cylinder with red painted (or &#8220;1&#8221; stamped).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Also, a letter &#8220;A&#8221; or &#8220;B&#8221; is stamped on piston head but ordinarily it is not necessary to discriminate each piston by this letter.
