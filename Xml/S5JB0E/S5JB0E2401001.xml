Tires Description
</title>
<ptxt>
The tire is of tubeless type. The tire is designed to operate satisfactorily with loads up to the full rated load capacity when inflated to the recommended inflation pressures.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Correct tire pressures and driving habits have an important influence on tire life. Heavy cornering, excessively rapid acceleration, and unnecessary sharp braking increase tire wear.
</ptxt>

<title>
Tire Placard
</title>
<ptxt>
The &#8220;Tire Placard&#8221; is located on the left or right door lock pillar and should be referred to tire information.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The placard lists the maximum load, tire size and cold tire pressure where applicable.
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
Whether rim size and&#x002F;or maximum load are listed or not depends on regulations of each country.

Inflation of Tires
</title>
<ptxt>
The pressure recommended for any model is carefully calculated to give a satisfactory ride, stability, steering, tread wear, tire life and resistance to bruises.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Tire pressure, with tires cold, (after vehicle has set for 3 hours or more, or driven less than one mile) should be checked monthly or before any extended trip. Set to the specifications on the &#8220;Tire Placard&#8221; located on the left or right door lock pillar.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
It is normal for tire pressure to increase when the tires become hot during driving.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Do not bleed or reduce tire pressure after driving. Bleeding reduces the &#8220;Cold Inflation Pressure&#8221;.

Matched Tires and Wheels (Steel Type)
</title>
<ptxt>
Tires and wheels are match mounted at the assembly plant.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
This means that the radially stiffest part of the tire, or &#8220;high spot&#8221;, is matched to the smallest radius or &#8220;low spot&#8221; of the wheel.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
This is done to provide the smoothest possible ride.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The &#8220;high spot&#8221; of the tire is originally marked by paint dot (1) on the outboard sidewall. This paint dot will eventually wash off the tire.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The &#8220;low spot&#8221; of the wheel is originally marked by paint dot (2) on the wheel rim-flange. Properly assembled, the wheel rims&#8217; paint dot should be aligned with the tires&#8217; paint dot as shown in figure.
</ptxt>
<figure>
<graphic graphicname = "I2RH01240001.swf" width = "88.000mm" height = "66.282mm" ver = "01" gw = "154" gh = "171"/>
</figure>
<ptxt>
Whenever a tire is dismounted from its wheel, it should be remounted so that the tire and wheel are matched. If the tire&#8217;s paint dot cannot be located, a line should be scribed on the tire and wheel before dismounting to assure that it is remounted in the same position.
</ptxt>

<title>
Replacement Tires
</title>
<ptxt>
When replacement is necessary, the original equipment type tire should be used. Refer to the &#8220;Tire Placard&#8221;. Replacement tires should be of the same size, load range and construction as those originally on the vehicle. Use of any other size or type tire may affect ride, handling, speedometer &#x002F; odometer calibration, vehicle ground clearance and tire or snow chain clearance to the body and chassis.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
It is recommended that new tires be installed in pairs on the same axle. If necessary to replace only one tire, it should be paired with the tire having the most tread, to equalize braking traction.
</ptxt>
<attention1>
<ptxt>
Do not mix different types of tires on the same vehicle such as radial, bias and bias-belted tires except in emergencies, because handling may be seriously affected and may result in loss of control.
</ptxt>
</attention1>
<ptxt>
The metric term for tire inflation pressure is the kilo pascal (kPa). Tire pressures is usually printed in both kPa and kgf&#x002F;cm&#x00B2; on the &#8220;Tire Placard&#8221;.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Metric tire gauges are available from tool suppliers.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The chart, shown the table, converts commonly used inflation pressures from kPa to kgf&#x002F;cm&#x00B2; and psi.
