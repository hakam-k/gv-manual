Engine Lubrication Description
</title>
<ptxt>
The oil pump is trochoid type, and mounted under the crankshaft. Oil is drawn up through the oil pump strainer and passed through the pump to the oil filter.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The filtered oil flows into two paths in cylinder block.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
In one path, oil reaches the crankshaft journal bearings. Oil from the crankshaft journal bearings is supplied to the connecting rod bearings by means of intersecting passages drilled in the crankshaft.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
In the other path oil goes up to the cylinder head and lubricates valves and camshafts, etc., after passing through the internal oilway of camshafts.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
An oil relief valve is provided on the oil pump. This valve starts relieving oil pressure when the pressure exceeds specified pressure.
