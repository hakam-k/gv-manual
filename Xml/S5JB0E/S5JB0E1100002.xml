Precautions in Diagnosing Trouble
</title>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Don&#8217;t disconnect couplers from ECM, battery cable from battery, ECM ground wire harness from engine or main fuse before confirming diagnostic information (DTC, freeze frame data, etc.) stored in ECM memory. Such disconnection will erase memorized information in ECM memory.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Diagnostic information stored in ECM memory can be cleared as well as checked by using SUZUKI scan tool or OBD generic scan tool (Vehicle without diagnosis connector). Before using scan tool, read its Operator&#8217;s (Instruction) Manual carefully to have good understanding as to what functions are available and how to use it.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
It is indistinguishable which module turns on MIL because not only ECM but also TCM (for A&#x002F;T model) turns on MIL (For details of on-board diagnostic system for A&#x002F;T model, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S5JB0E5101008">On-Board Diagnostic System Description</intxref>
. Therefore, check both ECM and TCM (for A&#x002F;T model) for DTC when MIL lights on.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When checking ECM for DTC, keep in mind that DTC is displayed on the scan tool as follows depending on the scan tool used.

Priorities for diagnosing troubles
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If two or more DTCs are stored, proceed to the DTC flow which has been detected earliest in the order and follow the instruction in that flow.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If no instructions are given, troubleshoot DTCs according to the following priorities.

ECM replacement:
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When substituting a known-good ECM, check for the following conditions. Neglecting this check may cause damage to a known-good ECM.

Communication of ECM, BCM, combination meter, keyless start control module (if equipped), ABS &#x002F; ESP&#174; control module, 4WD control module (if equipped), steering angle sensor (if equipped) and TCM (for A&#x002F;T model) is established by CAN (Controller Area Network). (For more detail of CAN communication for ECM, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S5JB0E1101005">CAN Communication System Description</intxref>
). Therefore, handle CAN communication line with care referring to

Immobilizer transponder code registration after replacing ECM:
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When ECM is replaced with new one or with another one, make sure to register immobilizer transponder code with ECM correctly according to
