<attention1>
<ptxt>
Do not apply too highly compressed air which will cause piston to jump out of cylinder. Place a cloth (1) to prevent piston from damage, it should be taken out gradually with moderately compressed air. Do not place your fingers in front of piston when using compressed air.

Caliper
</title>
<ptxt>
Before installing caliper (cylinder body) to carrier, check to ensure that guide pin (pin bolt) inserted in each caliper carrier hole can be moved smoothly in thrust direction.
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
Where temperature gets as low as &#8211;30 &#176;C in cold weather, use rubber grease whose viscosity varies very little even at &#8211;40 &#176;C (&#8211;40 &#176;F).
