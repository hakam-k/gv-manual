Generator Control System Description
</title>
<ptxt>
Generator Control System consists of a generator (1), electric load current sensor (7) (for J20 engine) located in the fuse box No.1 (4) and ECM (5).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
ECM controls generated electricity (adjusting voltage of IC regulator (2)) so that it is suitable for the engine and electric load conditions. When the electric load increases quickly, generation load of the generator increases quickly and causes idling to change. To prevent this, ECM makes generated electricity volume vary gradually to stabilize idling. Also, it reduces the engine load caused by temporary increase in electricity generation to cope with the engine condition (such as when accelerating).

Operation
</title>
<ptxt>
ECM controls the generated voltage of the generator using &#8220;C&#8221; terminal (generator control terminal) duty, based on following information.
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Engine condition (ECT, vehicle speed, engine speed, TP, etc.) (9)
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Battery voltage (ECM backup power voltage) (10)
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Electric load condition (blower motor, rear defogger, head lights, radiator fan, A&#x002F;C, etc.) (11)
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
&#8220;FR&#8221; terminal output (field coil (3) control duty) which indicates the operation rate (electricity generation condition) of the generator.
</ptxt>
</item>
</list1>
<ptxt>
Then the generator uses &#8220;C&#8221; terminal duty to regulate the adjusting voltage of the IC regulator with the field coil control duty so as to control its generated voltage (&#8220;B&#8221; terminal output voltage).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
(For more information of the generated voltage, refer to Charging System in Section 1J.)
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Furthermore, with the J20 engine, the generation condition of the generator is controlled to the optimum level by the electric load current sensor (7) which detects the electrical load condition (current consumption) linearly even when a sudden electrical load variation occurs and thus the engine load is reduced.
