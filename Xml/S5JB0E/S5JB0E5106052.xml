When replacing pressure control solenoid valve and&#x002F;or TCC pressure control solenoid valve, it is strictly required to replace it together with valve body assembly as a set. Replacing pressure control solenoid valve and&#x002F;or TCC pressure control solenoid valve independently may cause excessive shift shock.
