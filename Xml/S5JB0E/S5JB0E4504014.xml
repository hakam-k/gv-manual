DTC Detecting Condition
</title>
<ptxt>
The ABS (ESP&#174;) control module monitors the current at the terminal of each sensor while the ignition switch is ON. When the current is not within the specified range, an applicable DTC will be set. Also, when no sensor signal is inputted at running, an applicable DTC will be set.
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
When the vehicle was operated in any of the following ways, one of these DTCs may be set even when the sensor is in good condition. If such possibility is suspected, clear DTC once referring to 
<intxref refid = "S5JB0E4504006">DTC Clearance</intxref>
 and then performing the driving test as described in Step 2 of 
<intxref refid = "S5JB0E4504001">ABS Check</intxref>
, check whether or not any abnormality exists.
