<attention2>
<ptxt>
After 2nd timing chain is removed, never turn intake camshaft, exhaust camshaft and crankshaft independently more than such an extent as shown. If turned, interference may occur between piston and valves and valves themselves, and parts related to piston and valves may be damaged.
