Tire Mounting and Dismounting
</title>
<ptxt>
Use a tire changing machine to mount or dismount tires. Follow equipment manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. Do not use hand tools or tire irons alone to change tires as they may damage tire beads or wheel rim.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Rim bead seats should be cleaned with a wire brush or coarse steel wool to remove lubricants, old rubber and light rust. Before mounting or dismounting a tire, bead area should be well lubricated with approved tire lubricant.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
After mounting, inflate to specified pressure shown on tire placard so that beads are completely seated.
</ptxt>
<attention1>
<ptxt>
Do not stand over tire when inflating. Bead may break when bead snaps over rim&#8217;s safety hump and cause serious personal injury.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Do not exceed specified pressure when inflating. If specified pressure will not seat beads, deflate, re-lubricate and reinflate.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Over inflation may cause bead to break and cause serious personal injury.
</ptxt>
</attention1>
<ptxt>
Install valve core and inflate to proper pressure.
