Described is the glass replacement by using 3 types of primers and 1 type of adhesive made by YOKOHAMA (one component urethane adhesive to be used with primer in combination). When using primer and adhesive made by other manufacturers, be sure to refer to handling instructions supplied with them. Negligence in following such procedure or misuse of the adhesive in any way hinders its inherent adhesive property. Therefore, before the work, make sure to read carefully the instruction and description given by the maker of the adhesive to be used and be sure to follow the procedure and observe each precaution throughout the work.
