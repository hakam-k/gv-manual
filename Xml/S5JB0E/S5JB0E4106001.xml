Excessive Pedal Travel Check
</title>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Start engine.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Depress brake pedal a few times.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
With brake pedal depressed with approximately 30 kg (66 lbs) load, measure pedal to carpet clearance &#8220;c&#8221;.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If clearance &#8220;c&#8221; is less than specification, the most possible cause is either rear brake shoes are worn out beyond limit or air is in lines.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Should clearance &#8220;c&#8221; remain less than specification even after replacement of brake shoes and bleeding of system, other possible but infrequent cause is malfunction of rear brake shoe adjusters or booster push rod length out of adjustment.
