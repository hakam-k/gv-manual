Electrical Circuit Inspection Procedure
</title>
<ptxt>
While there are various electrical circuit inspection methods, described here is a general method to check its open and short circuit by using an ohmmeter and a voltmeter.
</ptxt>
<servinfosub id = "S5JB0E0006001001">
<title>
Open Circuit Check
</title>
<ptxt>
Possible causes for the open circuit are as follows. As the cause is in the connector or terminal in many cases, they need to be checked particularly carefully.
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Loose connection of connector
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Poor contact of terminal (due to dirt, corrosion or rust on it, poor contact tension, entry of foreign object etc.)
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Wire harness being open
</ptxt>
</item>
</list1>
<ptxt>
When checking system circuits including an electronic control unit such as ECM, TCM, ABS control module, etc., it is important to perform careful check, starting with items which are easier to check.
</ptxt>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Disconnect negative cable from battery
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Check each connector at both ends of the circuit being checked for loose connection. Also check lock condition of connector if equipped with connector lock.

Using a test male terminal, check both terminals of the circuit being checked for contact tension of its female terminal. Check each terminal visually for poor contact (possibly caused by dirt, corrosion, rust entry of foreign object, etc.). At the same time, check to make sure that each terminal is locked in the connector fully.

Continuity Check
</title>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Measure resistance between connector terminals at both ends of the circuit being checked (between &#8220;A-1&#8221; and &#8220;C-1&#8221; in the figure). If no continuity is indicated (infinity or over limit), that means that the circuit is open between terminals &#8220;A-1&#8221; and &#8220;C-1&#8221;.
</ptxt>

<graphic graphicname = "I2RH01010052.swf" width = "88.000mm" height = "49.984mm" ver = "01" gw = "185" gh = "125"/>
</figure>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Disconnect the connector included in the circuit (connector-B in the figure) and measure resistance between terminals &#8220;A-1&#8221; and &#8220;B-1&#8221;.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If no continuity is indicated, that means that the circuit is open between terminals &#8220;A-1&#8221; and &#8220;B-1&#8221;. If continuity is indicated, there is an open circuit between terminals &#8220;B-1&#8221; and &#8220;C-1&#8221; or an abnormality in connector-B.

Voltage Check
</title>
<ptxt>
If voltage is supplied to the circuit being checked, voltage check can be used as circuit check.
</ptxt>
<s1>
<ptxt>
With all connectors connected and voltage applied to the circuit being checked, measure voltage between each terminal and body ground.
</ptxt>
<s2>
<ptxt>
If measurements were taken as shown in the figure and results were as listed in the following, it means that the circuit is open between terminals &#8220;B-1&#8221; and &#8220;A-1&#8221;.
</ptxt>
<spec>
<title>
Voltage between each terminal and body ground
</title>
<ptxt>
&#8220;C-1&#8221; and body ground: Approx. 5 V
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
&#8220;B-1&#8221; and body ground: Approx. 5 V
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
&#8220;A-1&#8221; and body ground: 0 V
</ptxt>
</spec>
</s2>
<s2>
<ptxt>
Also, if measured values were as listed in the following, it means that there is a resistance (abnormality) of such level that corresponds to the voltage drop in the circuit between terminals &#8220;A-1&#8221; and &#8220;B-1&#8221;.

Short Circuit Check (Wire Harness to Ground)
</title>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Disconnect negative cable at battery.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>

Disconnect connectors at both ends of the circuit to be checked.

If the circuit to be checked is connected to other parts (1), disconnect all connectors of those parts.

Otherwise, diagnosis will be misled.

Measure resistance between terminal at one end of circuit (&#8220;A-1&#8221; terminal in the figure) and body ground. If continuity is indicated, it means that there is a short to ground between terminals &#8220;A-1&#8221; and &#8220;C-1&#8221; of the circuit.
