Brake Pad
</title>
<ptxt>
Check pad lining for wear. When wear exceeds limit, replace with new one.
</ptxt>
<attention2>
<ptxt>
Never polish pad lining with sandpaper. If lining is polished with sandpaper, hard particles of sandpaper will be deposited in lining and may damage disc. When pad lining requires correction, replace it with a new one.
</ptxt>
</attention2>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
When pads are removed, visually inspect caliper for brake fluid leak. Correct leaky point, if any.

Brake Disc
</title>
<ptxt>
Before this inspection, brake pads must be removed.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Check disc surface for scratches in wearing parts. Scratches on disc surface noticed at the time of specified inspection or replacement are normal and disc is not defective unless they are serious.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
But when there are deep scratches or scratches all over disc surface, replace it. When only one side is scratched, polish and correct that side.

Use wheel nuts (1) and suitable plain washers (2) to hold the disc securely against the hub, then mount a dial gauge (3) as shown in the figure and measure the runout at 25 mm (0.98 in.) from the outer edge of the disc.

Check front wheel bearing for looseness before measurement.
