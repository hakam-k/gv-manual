<s1>
<ptxt>
Turn ignition switch ON.

</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Refer to SUZUKI scan tool operator&#8217;s manual for further details.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If communication between SUZUKI scan tool and BCM is not possible, check if SUZUKI scan tool is communicable by connecting it to BCM in another vehicle. If communication is possible in this case, SUZUKI scan tool is in good condition. Then check data link connector and serial data line (circuit) in the vehicle with which communication was not possible.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
After completing the check, turn ignition switch off and disconnect SUZUKI scan tool from data link connector.
