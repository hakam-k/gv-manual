Flow Control Valve (Relief Valve)
</title>
<ptxt>
As the discharge rate of the P&#x002F;S pump increases in proportion to the pump revolution speed, a flow control valve is added to control it so that the optimum amount of fluid for steering operation is supplied according to the engine speed (driving condition).
