Manual Transmission Construction
</title>
<ptxt>
The manual transmission consists of the input shaft, output shaft, countershaft and reverse idle gear shaft which are installed in the die-cast aluminum alloy case. This transmission provides five forward speeds and one reverse speed.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th speeds are for speed reduction drive, 5th speed is for direct drive. The low speed (1st and 2nd) synchronizer is mounted on the countershaft and engaged with the countershaft 1st or 2nd gear. The high speed (3rd and 4th) synchronizer is mounted on of the input shaft and engaged with the input shaft 3rd and 4th gear. The 5th speed synchronizer is mounted on the input shaft and engaged with the output shaft. The gear shift lever case is located at the upper behind the transmission case and has a cam which prevents direct gear shifting from the 5th speed gear into the reverse gear.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
As the die-cast aluminum alloy case are sealed with liquid type gasket, it is necessary to use genuine sealant or its equivalent on its mating surface when reassembling them. Also, the case fastening bolts must be tightened to specified torque by means of the torque wrench and tightening over or below the specified torque should be avoided.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The description under &#8220;Repair Instructions&#8221; covers the transfer partially which is next to the transmission as well, but their gear boxes are independent and each of them has its own drain and filler plugs for the oil change or the level check.
