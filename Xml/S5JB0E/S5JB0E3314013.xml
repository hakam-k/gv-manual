Circuit Description
</title>
<ptxt>
Transfer position indicator operates according to the signal from 4WD control module. If the transfer control system is in good condition, transfer position indicator light up for 2 seconds when ignition switch is turned to ON position, and then turned to OFF position. If an abnormality is detected in the system, transfer position indicator remains lighting.

CAN communication circuit check
</title>
<test1>
<ptxt>
Check CAN communication circuit between combination meter and 4WD control module referring to 
<intxref refid = "S5JB0E3314026">DTC U1073: Control Module Communication Bus Off:Motor-Shift Type (Transfer with Shift Actuator)</intxref>
