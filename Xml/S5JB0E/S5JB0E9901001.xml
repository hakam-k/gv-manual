Power Sliding (Sun) Roof System Description
</title>
<ptxt>
The controller is included in the sliding roof motor unit.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The sliding roof functions are controlled with the sliding roof position data. Sliding roof position and sliding direction are detected by the controller referring to pulse signals from motor.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Initialization of the sliding roof position data is required in the following situation to reset anti-pinching function: battery cable or motor connector is disconnected since the sliding roof position data is deleted without power supply to the motor. Refer to &#8220;How to reactivate the system to prevent being pinched by the sunroof&#8221; in Sunroof section of Owner&#8217;s manual to initialize the sliding roof position data.
