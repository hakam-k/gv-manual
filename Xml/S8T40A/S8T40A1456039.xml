Main Bearing Clearance
</title>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
Do not rotate crankshaft while gauging plastic is installed.
</ptxt>
</attention3>
<ptxt>
Check clearance by using gauging plastic according to the following procedure.
</ptxt>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Remove bearing caps.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Clean bearings and main journals.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Place a piece of gauging plastic (1) the full width of bearing (parallel to crankshaft) on journal, avoiding oil hole.
</ptxt>

Install main bearing caps referring to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40A1456066">Main Bearing, Crankshaft and Cylinder Block Removal and Installation:F9Q</intxref>
.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Remove bearing caps and using scale (1) on gauging plastic envelop (2), measure gauging plastic width at its widest point. If clearance exceeds its limit, replace bearing. Always replace both upper and lower inserts as a unit.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
A new main bearing may produce proper clearance. If not, replace crankshaft and&#x002F;or cylinder block.
