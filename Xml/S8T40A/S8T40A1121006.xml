Operation Description
</title>
<ptxt>
ECM (5) detects depressed extent of the accelerator pedal based on the signal voltage of the APP sensor (1). Using that data and engine operation condition, ECM calculates the optimum throttle valve opening. On the other hand, it detects the throttle valve opening based on the signal voltage of the TP sensor (3) in the throttle body assembly (2) and compares it with the above calculated optimum throttle valve opening. When there is a difference between them, ECM controls the duty ratio (100&#x0025; &#8211; 0&#x0025;) of throttle motor control according to this difference to drive the throttle motor (4) in the throttle body. When there is no difference, ECM controls the duty ratio of throttle motor control to about 15&#x0025; to maintain the throttle valve opening. In this way, the throttle valve (17) is opened and closed to achieve the optimum throttle valve opening.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
In this system, TP sensor and APP sensor have 2 sensors (main and sub) each to assure highly accurate and highly reliable control and abnormality detection. Also, when ECM detects an abnormality in the system, it turns off the throttle motor control relay (8) to stop controlling the throttle motor. When the throttle motor control relay is turned off, the throttle valve is fixed at the opening of about 7&#176; (default opening) from its completely closed position by the balance of the return spring and open spring in the throttle body.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
This throttle body is not equipped with IAC valve for idle speed control. Idle speed control is performed by the throttle motor by adjusting the throttle valve opening.
