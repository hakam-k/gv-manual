Precautions for Diagnosing Trouble

For type definition of OBD system, refer to

Don&#8217;t disconnect ECM connectors from ECM, battery cable from battery, ECM ground wire harness from engine, main fuse, &#8220;DOME&#8221; fuse or &#8220;B&#x002F;U&#8221; fuse before confirming diagnostic information (DTC, freeze frame data, etc.) stored in ECM memory. Such disconnection erases memorized information in ECM memory if battery is disconnected before main relay is turned off.
</ptxt>

<ptxt>
Diagnostic information stored in ECM memory can be cleared as well as checked by using SUZUKI scan tool or CAN communication OBD generic scan tool (Type A, B and C). Before using scan tool, read its Operator&#8217;s (Instruction) Manual carefully to have good understanding as to what functions are available and how to use it.

It is unable to distinguish which module, ECM or TCM turns on MIL. (For details of on-board diagnostic system for A&#x002F;T model, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40A5111008">A&#x002F;T Diagnosis General Description:4 A/T</intxref>
). Therefore, check both ECM and TCM for DTC when MIL lights on.

When checking ECM for DTC, keep in mind that DTC is displayed on the scan tool as follows depending on the scan tool.

Priorities for diagnosing troubles
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If two or more DTCs are stored, proceed to the flow of the DTC which has detected earliest in the order and follow the instruction in that table.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If no instructions are given, troubleshoot DTCs according to the following priorities.

ECM Replacement
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When ECM is replaced with new one or substituted one, check for the following conditions. Neglecting this check may cause damage to ECM.
</ptxt>
</item>
<list2 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Resistance value of all relays and actuators are as specified respectively.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
APP sensor, TP sensor and A&#x002F;C refrigerant pressure sensor are in good condition and none of power circuits of these sensors is shorted to ground.

Communication of ECM, BCM, combination meter, keyless start control module, ABS &#x002F; ESP&#174; control module, 4WD control module, steering angle sensor (ESP&#174; model) and TCM, is established by CAN (Controller Area Network). (For more detail of CAN communication for ECM, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40AA821001">CAN Communication System Description:J24B and N32A Model</intxref>
).
</ptxt>

Therefore, handle CAN communication line with care referring to

Immobilizer transponder code registration after replacing ECM
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When ECM is replaced with new one or substituted one, make sure to register immobilizer transponder code.
