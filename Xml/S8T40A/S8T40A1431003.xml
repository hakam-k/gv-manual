IMRC (Intake Manifold Runner Control) System Description (If Equipped)
</title>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
The IMRC (Intake Manifold Runner Control) system reduces fuel consumption and exhaust emission by producing the tumble air flow which makes A&#x002F;F leaner when the engine is idling at low temperature.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
The tumble air flow is generated by opening &#x002F; closing the IMRC valve located between the intake manifold and the cylinder head.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
The IMRC system consists of the following items.
</ptxt>
</item>
<list2 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
IMRC valve (1)
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
IMRC valve actuator (2) (including in the IMRC valve motor and the IMRC valve position sensor)

<item>
<ptxt>
The ECM drives the IMRC valve motor which is included in the IMRC valve actuator according to a vehicle speed, an engine speed, a coolant temperature and an accelerator pedal position.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
When the IMRC valve (1) closing conditions are met, the ECM sends &#8220;closing&#8221; signal to the IMRC valve motor. The IMRC valve motor closes the IMRC valve to create the tumble air flow (2).
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
When the IMRC valve closing conditions are not met, The ECM sends &#8220;opening&#8221; signal to the IMRC valve motor. The IMRC valve motor opens the IMRC valve.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
The ECM detects an IMRC valve position by a non-contact type IMRC valve position sensor.
