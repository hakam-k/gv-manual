Troubleshooting
</title>
<attention2>
<ptxt>
EGR valve data initialization procedure is required when the EGR valve is replaced.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The &#8220;EGR valve initial offset&#8221; and &#8220;EGR valve last offset&#8221; parameters must be reinitialised.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Refer to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40A1346025">EGR Valve Data Initialization:F9Q</intxref>
 to carry out this programming.
</ptxt>

<ptxt>
Check the EGR valve connections.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Check the ECM connections.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Repair if necessary.

Measure the resistance of the EGR valve motor between &#8220;C10-4&#8221; and &#8220;C10-6&#8221; terminals.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If the resistance displayed is not approximately 2.66 &#8211; 3.26 &#937; at 20 &#176;C, 68 &#176;F, replace the EGR valve.

Check the operation of the EGR valve:
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Perform &#8220;Initialize EGR valve data&#8221; on SUZUKI scan tool to reinitialise the operating values of the valve and launch a programming procedure for the EGR offsets (Refer to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40A1346025">EGR Valve Data Initialization:F9Q</intxref>
).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If the valve is jammed or irrevocably seized, replace the EGR valve.
