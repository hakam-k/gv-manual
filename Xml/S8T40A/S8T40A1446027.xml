Remove all carbon deposits from combustion chambers.
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
Do not use any sharp-edged tool to scrape off carbon deposits. Be careful not to scuff or nick metal surfaces when removing carbon. The same applies to valves and valve seats, too.

Check cylinder head for cracks on intake and exhaust ports, combustion chambers, and head surface.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Using a straightedge (1) and thickness gauge (2), check flatness of cylinder block mating surface at a total of 6 locations. If distortion limit is exceeded, correct mating surface with surface plate and abrasive paper of about &#x0023;400 (Waterproof silicon carbide abrasive paper): place abrasive paper on surface plate and rub mating surface against paper to grind off high spots. If distortion exceeds 0.25 mm (0.0098 in.), replace cylinder head. 
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Leakage of combustion gases from this gasketed joint is often due to warped mating surface: such leakage results in reduced power output.

Check seating faces of cylinder head for manifolds, using straightedge and thickness gauge, in order to determine whether these faces should be corrected or cylinder head replaced.
