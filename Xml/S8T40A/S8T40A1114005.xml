<ptxt>
When ECM receives a trouble code from TCM, which indicates that some problem occurred in sensor circuits and its calculated values used for operations such as idle speed control, engine power control, and so on by TCM, ECM sets DTC P1603. (TCM outputs the trouble code to ECM when TCM can not compute the engine control signal due to malfunctions of sensor circuits used for gear shift control.)
