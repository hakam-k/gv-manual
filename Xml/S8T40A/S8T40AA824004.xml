<ptxt>
When &#8220;CAN Communication Bus Off&#8221; is detected in any control modules, or when it is not possible to communicate with any control modules by using SUZUKI scan tool (SUZUKI SDT), perform inspection using the following procedure.
</ptxt>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Connect SUZUKI scan tool (SUZUKI SDT) and have DTC of ECM displayed to check for communication with ECM. If scan tool fails to communicate with ECM, check SUZUKI scan tool and communication cable, DLC power and ground circuit.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If communication is in good condition, proceed on to next Step.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Using oscilloscope or oscilloscope function of SUZUKI scan tool (SUZUKI SDT), observe both CAN High terminal (1) and CAN Low terminal (2) for CAN communication signal waveform at DLC on the following condition when ignition switch is at ON position.
