Air Intake System Description
</title>
<ptxt>
The main components of the air intake system are air cleaner (1), air cleaner outlet hose (2), throttle body (3) (for details, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40A1121006">Description of Electric Throttle Control System:J24B</intxref>
.), IMT valve (4) which adjusts the distributor pipe length of intake manifold to (A) or (B) (for details, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40A1431002">IMT (Intake Manifold Tuning) System Description:J24B</intxref>
.), intake manifold (5) and IMRC valve (6) (if equipped) (for details, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40A1431003">IMRC (Intake Manifold Runner Control) System Description (If Equipped):J24B</intxref>
).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The air (by the amount corresponding to throttle valve (7) opening and engine speed) is filtered by the air cleaner, distributed by the intake manifold, and finally drawn into each combustion chamber. Throttle body is not equipped with IAC valve for idle speed control. Idle speed control is done by the throttle actuator (8) which opens and closes the throttle valve. (For details, refer to
