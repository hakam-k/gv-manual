Precautions in Diagnosing Trouble
</title>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Do not disconnect connectors from TCM, battery cable from battery, TCM ground wire harness from engine or main fuse before checking the diagnostic information (DTC, freeze frame data, etc.) stored in TCM memory. Such disconnection will clear memorized information in TCM memory.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
For E-OBD model, diagnostic information stored in TCM memory can be cleared as well as checked by using SUZUKI scan tool or OBD generic scan tool. Before using scan tool, read its Operator&#8217;s (Instruction) Manual carefully to have good understanding as to what functions are available and how to use it.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
It is indistinguishable which module turns on MIL because not only ECM but also TCM turns on MIL. Therefore, check both ECM and TCM for DTC when MIL lights on.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When checking TCM for DTC, keep in mind that DTC is displayed on the scan tool as follows depending on the scan tool used.

SUZUKI scan tool displays DTC detected by TCM.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
OBD generic scan tool displays DTC detected by each of ECM and TCM simultaneously.
</ptxt>
</item>
</list2>
<item>
<ptxt>
For non-E-OBD model, using SUZUKI scan tool the diagnostic information stored in TCM memory can be checked and cleared as well. Before its use, be sure to read Operator&#8217;s Manual supplied with it carefully to have good understanding of its functions and usage.

When replacing TCM with used one, all learned controls which are stored in TCM memory should be erased after the replacement referring to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40A5126001">TCM Learning Control Initialization:5 A/T</intxref>
. Neglecting this initialization may cause excessive shift shock.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Be sure to read 
<intxref refid = "S8T40A0000008">Precautions for Electrical Circuit Service</intxref>
 before inspection and observe what is written there.

TCM and&#x002F;or ECM replacement:
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When substituting a known-good TCM and&#x002F;or ECM, check for the following conditions.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Neglecting this check may result in damage to a good TCM and&#x002F;or ECM.

All relays and actuators have resistance of specified value.

MAF and IAT sensor and TP sensor are in good condition. Also, the power circuit of these sensors is not shorted to the ground.

Communication of ECM, TCM, BCM, combination meter, keyless start control module (if equipped), ABS &#x002F; ESP&#174; control module, 4WD control module, HVAC control module (if equipped) steering angle sensor (ESP&#174; model) and DLC, is established by CAN (Controller Area Network). (For more detail of CAN communication for ECM, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40AA821001">CAN Communication System Description:J24B and N32A Model</intxref>
). Therefore, handle CAN communication line with care referring to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40A0000007">Precaution for CAN Communication System</intxref>
