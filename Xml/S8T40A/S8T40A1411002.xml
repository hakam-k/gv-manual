Camshaft Position Control (VVT Variable Valve Timing) System Description
</title>
<servinfosub id = "S8T40A1411002001">
<title>
System Description
</title>
<ptxt>
The VVT system is an electronic control system which continuously vary and optimize the intake valve timing in response to the engine operating condition.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The optimized intake valve timing produce such an air intake with high efficiency that both the higher power generation and lower fuel consumption can be attained in the whole engine speed range from low to high. In the area of the average engine load, low emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and high fuel efficiency can also be attained by making the valve opening overlap between the intake and exhaust valves longer.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
For the brief of the system operation, the intake valve timing is varied by the cam timing sprocket (1) which varies the rotational phase between the intake camshaft (3) and sprocket. The rotor (2) in the cam timing sprocket is actuated by switching or adjusting the hydraulic pressure applied to the chambers for the timing advancing (7) and&#x002F;or retarding (6). To switch or adjust the hydraulic pressure appropriately, ECM operates the oil control valve (12) with detecting the engine speed, intake air value, throttle opening, engine coolant temperature and camshaft position (angle).

Oil Control Valve
</title>
<ptxt>
The oil control valve switches and adjusts the hydraulic pressure applied to the cam timing sprocket by moving the spool valve (1) according to the duty pulse signals output from the ECM. By this operation, the intake valve timing is varied continuously. Signals output from the ECM are the duty pulse of about 240 Hz.

Cam Timing Sprocket
</title>
<ptxt>
The cam timing sprocket is equipped with the chambers for timing advancing (2) and retarding (3) which are separated by the rotor (5). The rotor rotates receiving the hydraulic pressure applied to both the chambers. The sprocket (1) is installed on the housing (4) and the rotor is secured on the intake camshaft by fastening the bolts. Therefore, the actuation of the rotor makes the phase difference between the sprocket and intake camshaft.

Timing Advancing
</title>
<ptxt>
When the duty ratio of the signal output from the ECM is heavy, the spool valve (4) of the oil control valve moves to the left (opposite direction against the coil (5)). By this spool valve movement, the pressurized oil (1) is led into the chambers for timing advancing and the oil in the chambers for timing retarding is drained. This operations actuate the rotor (3) and result in the advanced timing of the intake valve.

Timing Holding
</title>
<ptxt>
When the duty ratio of the signal output from the ECM shows that of holding, the spool valve of the oil control valve is located at hold position. Because this condition generates no oil pressure changes in both chambers, the rotor is fixed at a target position.

Timing Retarding
</title>
<ptxt>
When the duty ratio of the signal output from the ECM is light, the spool valve of the oil control valve moves to the right (head for the coil). By this spool valve movement, the pressurized oil is led into the chambers for timing retarding and the oil in the chambers for timing advancing is drained. This operations actuate the rotor and result in the retarded timing of the intake valve.
