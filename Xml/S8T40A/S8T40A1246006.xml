EGR Valve Inspection
</title>
<attention2>
<ptxt>
Do not disassemble EGR valve, or original performance will be spoiled.
</ptxt>
</attention2>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Check EGR valve for the following.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If malfunction is found, replace EGR valve.

<ptxt>
Check EGR valve operation by ECM signal as follows.
</ptxt>
<s2>
<ptxt>
Turn ignition switch to OFF position.
</ptxt>
</s2>
<s2>
<ptxt>
Connect EGR valve connector (1) to EGR valve (2).
</ptxt>
</s2>
<s2>
<ptxt>
Turn ignition switch to ON position.
</ptxt>
</s2>
<s2>
<ptxt>
Check EGR valve opens and closes each approx. 10 times repeatedly and automatically after turning ignition switch to OFF position.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If EGR valve does not operate at all, go to next step.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If EGR valve operates correctly, EGR valve is in good condition.

Check pulse signal for EGR valve as follows.
</ptxt>
<s2>
<ptxt>
Disconnect EGR valve connector.
</ptxt>
</s2>
<s2>
<ptxt>
Turn ignition switch to ON position.
</ptxt>
</s2>
<s2>
<ptxt>
Measure operating pulse signal between terminal &#8220;4&#8221; and terminal &#8220;6&#8221; of EGR valve connector using oscilloscope after turning ignition switch to OFF position.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If pulse signal shown in figure can be measured, replace EGR valve.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If not, check connection and wiring harness between EGR valve and ECM.
