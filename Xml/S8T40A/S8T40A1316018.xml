Connect battery positive (&#x002B;) terminal to terminal &#8220;B&#8221; of relay. Connect battery negative (&#8211;) terminal to terminal &#8220;A&#8221; of relay. Check for continuity between terminal &#8220;C&#8221; and &#8220;D&#8221;. If there is no continuity when relay is connected to the battery, replace relay.
