Rear Disc Brake Description
</title>
<ptxt>
Rear brake is a disc type. Hydraulic force, created by applying force to the brake pedal, is converted by the caliper to friction. The hydraulic force acts equally against the piston and the bottom of the caliper bore to move the piston outward and to move (slide) the caliper inward, resulting in a clamping action on the disc. This clamping action forces the pads (linings) against the disc, creating friction to stop the vehicle.

If any hydraulic component is removed or brake line disconnected, bleed the brake system. The torque values specified are for dry, unlubricated fasteners.
