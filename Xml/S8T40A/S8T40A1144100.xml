This fault can result in a rapid and significant fouling of the diesel particulate filter.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
This fault may appear if the wiring harness has been damaged.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Follow the procedure described in

Conditions for applying fault finding procedures to stored faults:
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The fault is declared present after the engine has been started.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
If CC1, CC, or D1 is present, the Red stop warning light (gravity 2 warning light) is lit.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
If CO is present the Injection warning light (gravity 1 warning light) is lit.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
If CO is still present, the Malfunction indicator light (MIL) will come on after three consecutive driving cycles (starting &#x002B;5 seconds &#x002B; turn OFF ignition switch and wait 40 seconds.).
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
If the fault is present, the injection on cylinder 4 is disabled.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Use service wire for all operations on the ECM connectors.
