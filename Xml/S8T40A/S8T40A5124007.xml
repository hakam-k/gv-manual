<ptxt>
As the data values given in the following table are standard values estimated on the basis of values obtained from the normally operating vehicles by using a scan tool, use them as reference value. Even when the vehicle is in good condition, there may be cases where the checked value does not fall within each specified data range. Therefore, judgment as abnormal should not be made by checking with these data alone.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Also, condition in the following table that can be checked by the scan tool are those detected by TCM and output from TCM as commands and there may be cases where the automatic transmission or actuator is not operating (in the condition) as indicated by the scan tool.
