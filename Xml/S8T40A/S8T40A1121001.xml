The engine and emission control systems in this vehicle are controlled by ECM.

 and each item in 
<intxref refid = "S8T40A1120002">Precautions for Diagnosing Trouble:J24B</intxref>
 and execute diagnosis according to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40A1124001">Engine and Emission Control System Check:J24B</intxref>

There is a close relationship between the emission system, engine mechanical, engine cooling system, ignition system, exhaust system, etc. in their structure and operation. In case of an engine trouble, even when the malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) doesn&#8217;t turn on, it should be diagnosed according to
