System Description
</title>
<ptxt>
The CKP sensor located on the cylinder block consists of the signal generator (magnetic sensor) and sensor plate (fixed to crankshaft).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The signal generator generates reference signal through slits in the sensor plate which turns together with the crankshaft.
</ptxt>
</servinfosub>
<servinfosub id = "S8T40A1124031004">
<title>
Reference signal
</title>
<ptxt>
The CKP sensor generates 30 pulses of signals each of which has a different waveform length while the crankshaft makes one full rotation. Refer to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40A1124063">Inspection of ECM and Its Circuits:J24B</intxref>
.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Based on CMP sensor signal and CKP sensor signal, ECM judges which cylinder piston is in the compression stroke.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
 Also, ECM judge engine speed based on CKP sensor signal.
