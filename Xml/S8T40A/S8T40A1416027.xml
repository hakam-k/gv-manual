Valve Spring Free Length and Preload
</title>
<ptxt>
Referring to data, check to be sure that each spring is in sound condition, free of any evidence of breakage or weakening. Remember, weakened valve springs can cause chatter, not to mention possibility of reducing power output due to gas leakage caused by decreased seating pressure.

Spring Squareness

<ptxt>
Use a square and surface plate to check each spring for squareness in terms of clearance between end of valve spring and square. Valve springs found to exhibit a larger clearance than limit must be replaced.
