Throttle Body Assembly On-Vehicle Inspection
</title>
<attention1>
<ptxt>
Never touch throttle valve with finger while ignition switch is in ON position and accelerator pedal is depressed. Otherwise, injury may result by pinching the finger between throttle valve and throttle body.
</ptxt>
</attention1>
<attention2>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Do not disassemble throttle body assembly.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Do not drop or otherwise give excessive shock to throttle body assembly. Throttle body assembly that has experienced any excessive shock must be replaced.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Be careful not to accurate foreign materials (like dust and metallic particle) to throttle body and throttle valve.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Otherwise, throttle body assembly will break down by throttle valve accretion.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Do not apply excessive force to throttle valve for throttle valve operation check and TP sensor performance check.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Otherwise, throttle body assembly will break down by damaging internal resinous gear of throttle valve actuator.
</ptxt>
</item>
</list1>
</attention2>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
After replacing throttle body assembly, calibrate throttle valve position.
