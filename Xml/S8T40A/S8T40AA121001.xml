Cruise Control System Construction
</title>
<ptxt>
The cruise control system is a device which maintains a preset vehicle speed while driving at a high speed, e.g., on a highway. It allows the driver to drive his vehicle at a constant speed of 40 km&#x002F;h (25 mile&#x002F;h) or higher without depressing the accelerator pedal. The system also has such functions as to change the vehicle speed without operating the accelerator pedal (but using SET&#x002F;COAST and RES&#x002F;ACC switches), cancel cruise control (CANCEL switch) and resume the speed in memory automatically after cruise control is cancelled (RES&#x002F;ACC switch). The system mainly consists of electric throttle body assembly, ECM, cruise control switch (MAIN (ON&#x002F;OFF) switch, SET&#x002F;COAST switch, RES&#x002F;ACC switch and CANCEL switch), etc.
