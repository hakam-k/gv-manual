Combination Meter Symptom Diagnosis
</title>
<ptxt>
Combination meter controls operation of each meter, warning light and indicator light using information sent from each controller through CAN communication.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
For this reason, ti is necessary to diagnose trouble according to following inspection procedure when operation of combination meter is found faulty.
</ptxt>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Check combination meter power and ground circuit.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Using SUZUKI scan tool, check each DTC of all control modules.
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
If some DTC of some control module appears during inspection in Step 2), go to applicable DTC diag. flow.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
If any of troubles described in table below has occurred independently even though DTC display is normal during inspection in Step 2), inspect subject place according to instructions in table below.
