Engine Lubrication Description
</title>
<ptxt>
The oil pump is a trochoid rotor pump that is driven by the crankshaft via oil-pump-drive sprocket, oil pump chain, oil pump sprocket, balancer shaft No.1 and balancer shaft No.2. The pump draws up oil from the oil pan through the oil pump strainer. The oil delivered from the pump flows through the oil filter.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The filtered oil flows through the two paths in the cylinder block.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Through the first path, the oil reaches the crankshaft main bearings. After lubricating the crankshaft main bearings, the oil is supplied to the connecting rod bearings by way of the passages formed in the crankshaft and then injected through the oil jets to lubricate the pistons, piston rings and cylinder walls.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Through the second path, the oil goes up to the cylinder head and flows in the passages formed inside the camshafts to lubricate them and the valve mechanisms.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The oil pump has an oil relief valve. The valve opens when the oil pressure exceeds the preset limit to release it.
