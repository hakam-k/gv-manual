Waveform Check
</title>
<ptxt>
Using oscilloscope, check that CKP sensor signal is outputted properly referring to &#8220;Reference waveform No.20&#8221; and &#8220;Reference waveform No.21&#8221; of

</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If sensor signal is outputted properly, CKP sensor is in good condition.

Arrange 12 V battery (1) and connect its positive terminal to &#8220;Vin&#8221; terminal (2) and negative terminal to &#8220;Ground&#8221; terminal (3) of sensor. Then using ohmmeter, measure resistance between &#8220;Vout&#8221; terminal (4) of sensor and negative terminal of battery by passing magnetic substance (iron) (5) while keeping approximately 1 mm (0.03 in.) gap with respect to end face of CKP sensor.
