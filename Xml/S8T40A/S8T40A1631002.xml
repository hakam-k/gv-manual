Coolant Description
</title>
<ptxt>
The cooling system has been filled with a quality coolant that is a 50&#x002F;50 mixture of water and ethylene glycol antifreeze.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
This 50&#x002F;50 mixture coolant solution provides freezing protection to a temperature as low as &#8211;36 &#176;C (&#8211;33 &#176;F).
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Freeze protection down to &#8211;36 &#176;C (&#8211;33 &#176;F) is also important to ensure protection against corrosion and loss of coolant from boiling. This level of protection should be maintained even if freezing temperatures are not expected.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Ethylene glycol base antifreeze must be used when replenishing the system because of loss of coolant or providing added protection against freezing at temperature lower than &#8211;36 &#176;C (&#8211;33 &#176;F).
</ptxt>
</item>
</list1>
<attention2>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Ethanol or methanol base coolant or plain water alone should not be used in cooling system at any time as damage to cooling system could occur.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Coolant must be mixed with demineralized water or distilled water.
