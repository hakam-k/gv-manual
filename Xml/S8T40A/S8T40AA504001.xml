Self-Diagnosis Function
</title>
<ptxt>
The keyless start control module has self-diagnosis function to monitor the system components and circuits while the keyless start system is at work. When the keyless start control module detects an abnormality in the system, it saves the area where such abnormality has occurred as a DTC in its memory. The DTC stored in memory of the keyless start control module is indicated by the key indicator light in the combination meter flashing in a specific pattern. For DTC indication, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40AA504006">DTC Check</intxref>
 and for the clearing procedure, to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40AA504008">DTC Clearance</intxref>
