Ground Bolt Used on Painted Panels
</title>
<ptxt>
The bolts are specially designed to get good metal-to-metal contact on painted panels.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Be sure to use the specified ground bolt.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Using an ordinary bolt can cause poor grounding on painted panels.
</ptxt>
<attention2>
<ptxt>
Using this bolt on aluminum blocks will damage the screw hole of the block. Never use this bolt on aluminum blocks.
</ptxt>
</attention2>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
This ground bolt is not used on the engine block, the transmission case or the steering column mounting bracket (non-painted). Identify the bolt with the paint-scratch shape (1) on the screw.
