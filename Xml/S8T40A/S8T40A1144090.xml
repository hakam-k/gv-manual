Or using a voltmeter:
</ptxt>
</item>
<list2 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Connect the negative terminal of the voltmeter to &#8220;C90-1&#8221; wire of the solenoid valve connector and the positive terminal to &#8220;C90-2&#8221; wire.

</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Clear any solenoid valve faults and perform output test &#8220;Boost pressure valve&#8221; on SUZUKI scan tool.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The voltmeter should display five cycles of two successive voltages: ~ 2.5 V (opening cyclic ratio of 20&#x0025;) then ~ 8.75 V (opening cyclic ratio of 70&#x0025;).
</ptxt>
</item>

</item>
<list2 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>

</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Clear any solenoid valve faults and perform output test &#8220;Boost pressure valve&#8221; on SUZUKI scan tool.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The oscilloscope should display a square wave signal with an amplitude of 12.5 V (equal to the battery voltage) at a frequency of 140 Hz (with an opening cyclic ratio increasing successively from ~ 20 to ~ 70&#x0025;).
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
If the measurement is correct, replace the solenoid valve.
