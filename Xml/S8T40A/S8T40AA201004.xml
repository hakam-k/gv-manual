Security Alarm Description (If Equipped)

Operation
</title>
<ptxt>
The security alarm system provides a warning of an abnormal condition to those who are around. Its operation is as follows. While the system is in the stand-by mode (when 20 seconds or more elapsed after the door is locked using a keyless entry transmitter or door request switch), BCM monitors door lock status, door switch status and battery power supply voltage. When it detects an abnormal condition (door is unlocked by some way other than using keyless entry transmitter or door request switch and opened or cut off BCM power supply voltage temporarily), it activates the warning buzzer (located in combination meter), theft deterrent light, hazard warning relay and horn relay.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The security alarm system has 2 selectable modes.
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
&#8220;Inactive&#8221; mode: No operation
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
&#8220;Active&#8221; mode: Theft deterrent light blinks, hazard warning lights blink, warning buzzer (located in combination meter) sounds and horn sounds
</ptxt>
</item>
</list1>
<ptxt>
When &#8220;Active&#8221; mode is selected and the door is locked using keyless entry transmitter or door request switch, the theft deterrent light (1) flashes at 0.1 second interval for 20 seconds and the security alarm system is set to the stand-by mode (2). Once it is set to the stand-by mode, the theft deterrent light blinks at 2 second intervals.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When the system is set to stand-by mode and the door is unlocked by some way other than using keyless entry transmitter or door request switch and opened or cut off BCM power supply voltage temporarily, the alarm devices operate according to the selected mode as described above.
