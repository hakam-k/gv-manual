Precautions for Disassembly and Reassembly
</title>
<ptxt>
As the automatic transmission consists of high precision components, the following cautions should be strictly observed when handling its parts in disassembly and reassembly.
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Disassembling valve body assembly is prohibited in principle. However, a few parts can be disassembled.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When disassembling valve body component parts, confirm whether these parts are allowed to disassemble or not referring to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40A5126038">Valve Body Assembly Components:5 A/T</intxref>
.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Make sure to wash dirt off from the transmission so that no such dirt will enter the transmission during dismounting and remounting.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Select a clean place free from dust and dirt for overhauling.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Place a rubber mat on the work bench to protect parts from damage.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
When repairing automatic transmission, lint-free cloth (nylon cloth or paper towel) should be used.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
When separating the case joint, do not pry with a screwdriver or such but tap with a plastic hammer lightly.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Make sure to wash dirt off from the transmission so that no such dirt will enter the transmission during disassembly and reassembly.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Wash the disassembled parts in ATF (Automatic Transmission Fluid) or kerosene (using care not to allow ATF or kerosene to get on your face, etc.) and confirm that each fluid passage is not clogged by blowing air into it. But use ATF to wash the disc, resin washers and rubber parts.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Replace each gasket, oil seal and O-ring with a new one.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Apply ATF to sliding or rotating parts before reassembly.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
A new disc should be soaked in ATF at least 2 hours before use.
</ptxt>
