Replenish oil until oil level is brought to FULL level mark (hole) on oil level gauge (oil pan and oil filter capacity). The filter inlet is at the top of cylinder head cover. It is recommended to use engine oil of SG, SH, SJ, SL or SM grade.

<ptxt>
Select the appropriate oil viscosity according to the chart &#x005B;A&#x005D;.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
SAE 5W-30 is the best choice for good fuel economy, and good starting in cold weather.

Engine oil capacity is specified as follows.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
However, note that the amount of oil required when actually changing oil may somewhat differ from the data depending on various conditions (temperature, viscosity, etc.).

The specified engine oil and &#8220;proper engine oil viscosity chart &#x005B;A&#x005D;&#8221; included in this manual are given as typical ones.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The actual engine oil and proper engine oil viscosity, however, vary depending on the vehicle specifications and such typical chart may not be applicable to some models.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Therefore, for the specific information on the engine oil and proper engine oil viscosity, refer to &#8220;Engine Oil and Filter&#8221; section of the Owner&#8217;s Manual.
