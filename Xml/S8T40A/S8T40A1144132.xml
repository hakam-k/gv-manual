DTC P1431: Clogged Diesel Particulate Filter Failures
</title>
<attention2>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
After servicing, explain to the customer that it is necessary to regenerate the diesel particulate filter when diesel particulate filter warning light is lit in order to avoid unnecessary repairs.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
To regenerate the diesel particulate, customer must drive the vehicle until the light goes out, at a speed of 75 km&#x002F;h (47 mph) or higher for a while (max. 30 minutes).
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
If diesel particulate filter is replaced, be sure to initialize diesel particulate filter data in ECM.
</ptxt>
