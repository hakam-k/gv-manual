<intxrefpoff refid = "S8T40A6226002">Steering Wheel Removal and Installation:Diesel Engine Model</intxrefpoff>
</ptxt>
<attention2>
<ptxt>
Removal of the steering wheel allows the contact coil cable assembly to turn freely but do not turn the contact coil cable assembly more than allowable number of turns (about two and a half turns from the center position clockwise or counterclockwise respectively), or coil will break.
</ptxt>
</attention2>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Check that vehicle&#8217;s wheels (front tires) are set at straight-ahead position.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Check that ignition switch is at LOCK position.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Turn contact coil cable assembly (2) counterclockwise slowly with a light force till contact coil cable assembly will not turn any further.
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
Contact coil cable assembly can turn about 5 turns at maximum, that is, if it is at the center position, can turn about two and a half turns both clockwise and counterclockwise.
</ptxt>
</attention3>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
From the position where contact coil cable assembly (2) became unable to turn any further (it stopped), turn it back clockwise about two and a half rotations and align center mark with alignment mark (1).
