Coolant in cooling system may be extremely high in temperature, even exceeding the boiling point as it is under pressure. If radiator cap is removed in this condition, high-temperature and high-pressure coolant will instantaneously boil up and gush out; you could then be seriously scalded by hot coolant and steam. Furthermore, as coolant contains flammable anti-freeze material, coolant splashing over engine and fenders can start fire.
