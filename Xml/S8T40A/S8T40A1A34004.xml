Generator Test (Overcharged Battery Check)
</title>
<s1>
<ptxt>
To determine battery condition, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40A1A31001">Battery Description:F9Q</intxref>
.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
If obvious overcharged condition exists as evidenced by excessive spewing of electrolyte, measure generator &#8220;B&#8221; terminal voltage at engine 5,000 rpm.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
If measured voltage is higher than upper limit value, disassemble generator.

Check ground of brushes. If brushes are not grounded, replace coil assembly. Then check field coil for grounds and shorts.
