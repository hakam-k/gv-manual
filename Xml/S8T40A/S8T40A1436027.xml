Combustion Chamber
</title>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Remove all carbon deposits from all combustion chambers.
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
Do not use any sharp-edged tool to scrape off carbon deposits. Be careful not to scuff or nick metal surfaces when removing carbon deposits. The same applies to valves and valve seats, too.
</ptxt>

<item>
<ptxt>
Check cylinder head for cracks on intake and exhaust ports, combustion chambers, and head surface.

Cylinder Head Flatness
</title>
<ptxt>
Using a straightedge (1) and thickness gauge (2), check flatness of gasket surface at a total of 6 locations. 
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If any measure value exceeds its limit, correct gasket surface with a surface plate and abrasive paper of about &#x0023;400 (Waterproof silicon carbide abrasive paper): place abrasive paper on and over surface plate, and rub gasket surface against paper to grind off high spots. 
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If it is impossible to correct cylinder head distortion, replace cylinder head.
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
Distorted mating surface of cylinder head and cylinder head gasket causes combustion gas leakage, overheating and reduced power output.
