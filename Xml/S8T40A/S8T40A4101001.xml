Brakes Description
</title>
<ptxt>
When the foot brake pedal is depressed, hydraulic pressure is developed in the master cylinder to actuate pistons (two in front disc brake, two in rear disc brake or four in rear drum brake).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The master cylinder is a tandem type and it has two-independent operating circuits. One of them operates front-right and rear- left brakes. The other one operates front-left and rear-right brakes.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The ventilated disc is equipped for front brake. 
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Drum brake (leading &#x002F; trailing shoes) is equipped for rear brake of M16A engine model, and disc brake (ventilated disc) is equipped for rear brake of other than M16A engine models. 
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The parking brake system is mechanical. It applies brake force to only rear wheels by means of the cable and mechanical linkage system. 
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
In the case of rear drum brake model, when the parking brake lever is pulled, the rear brake shoe pushes inside of the brake drum outward, generating brake force.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
In the case of rear disc brake model, the brake shoe for the parking brake is installed to inside of the brake disc (drum-in disc). Just like the drum brake model, when the parking brake lever is pulled, the brake shoe for the parking brake pushes inside of the brake drum outward, and generating brake force.
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
The figure shows LHD model. Components of brake system in RHD and LHD models are the same but location of master cylinder and brake booster is opposite.
