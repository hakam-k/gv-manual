Battery Description
</title>
<ptxt>
The battery has three major functions in the electrical system.
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
It is a source of electrical energy for cranking the engine.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
It acts as a voltage stabilizer for the electrical system.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
It can, for a limited time, provide energy when the electrical load exceeds the output of generator.
</ptxt>
</item>
</list1>
<servinfosub id = "S8T40A1A21001001">
<title>
Battery Carrier and Hold-Down Clamp
</title>
<ptxt>
The battery carrier should be in good condition so that it will support the battery securely and keep it level. Before installing the battery, check that the battery carrier and hold-down clamp are clean and free from corrosion and that there are no foreign matter in the carrier.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
To prevent battery from shaking in its carrier, the hold-down clamp bolts should be tight enough but not over-tightened.
</ptxt>
</servinfosub>
<servinfosub id = "S8T40A1A21001002">
<title>
Electrolyte Freezing
</title>
<ptxt>
The freezing point of electrolyte depends on its specific gravity. Since freezing of may ruin the battery, it should be protected against freezing by keeping the battery in a fully charged condition. If a battery is frozen accidentally, it should not be charged until it is warmed.
</ptxt>
</servinfosub>
<servinfosub id = "S8T40A1A21001003">
<title>
Sulfation
</title>
<ptxt>
If the battery is allowed to stand for a long period in discharged condition, the lead sulfate becomes converted into a hard, crystalline substance, which will not easily turn back to the active material again during subsequent recharging. &#8220;Sulfation&#8221; means the result as well as the process of the substance reaction. Such a battery can be revived by very slow charging and may be restored to a usable condition but its capacity is lower than before.
</ptxt>
</servinfosub>
<servinfosub id = "S8T40A1A21001004">
<title>
Built-In Indicator (If Equipped)
</title>
<ptxt>
The battery has a built-in temperature compensated indicator in its top. This indicator is to be used with the following diagnostic procedure. When checking the indicator, make sure that the top of the battery is clean. A light may be needed in some poorly-lit areas.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Three types of indication are available under normal operation as follows.
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
<emph etype = "bold">
Green dot &#x005B;A&#x005D;
</emph>
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Battery is sufficiently charged for testing.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
<emph etype = "bold">
Dark &#x005B;B&#x005D;
</emph>
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Battery must be charged before testing. If there is a cranking complaint, battery should be tested as described in 
<intxref refid = "S8T40A1A24001">Battery Inspection:J24B and N32A</intxref>
. Charging and electrical systems should also be checked at this time.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
<emph etype = "bold">
Clear or light yellow &#x005B;C&#x005D;
</emph>
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
This means that fluid level is below the bottom of hydrometer. Its possible cause is excessive or prolonged charging, a broken case, excessive tipping or normal battery deterioration. When the battery is found in such condition, it is possible that high charging voltage is caused by the faulty charging system and therefore, charging and electrical systems need to be checked. If there is a trouble in cranking and its cause lies in the battery, it should be replaced.

Care of battery
</title>
<attention1>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Never expose battery to open flame or electric spark because of battery generating gas which is flammable and explosive.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Do not allow electrolyte to contact eyes, skin, fabrics, or painted surfaces as fluid is a corrosive acid. Flush any contacted area with water immediately and thoroughly.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Batteries should always be kept out of reach of children.
</ptxt>
</item>
</list1>
</attention1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
The battery is a very reliable component, but needs periodical attention.
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Keep the battery carrier clean.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Prevent rust formation on the terminal posts.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Keep electrolyte up to upper level uniformly in all cells. (If cell caps are equipped)
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
When keeping the battery on the vehicle over a long period of time, follow the instructions given below.
</ptxt>
</item>
<list2 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Weekly, start the engine and run it until it reaches normal operating temperature with engine speed at 2000 to 3000 rpm. Make sure all electric switches are turned off before storing the vehicle.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Recharge the battery twice a month to prevent it from discharging excessively. This is especially important when ambient temperature is low.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The battery discharges even when it is not used, while vehicles are being stored. Battery electrolyte can freeze and battery case can crack at cold ambient condition if the battery is not properly charged.
</ptxt>
</item>
</list2>
</list1>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Keep the battery cable connections clean.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The cable connections, particularly at the positive (&#x002B;) terminal post, tend to become corroded. The product of corrosion, or rust, on the mating faces of conductors hinders the flow of current.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Clean the terminals and fittings periodically to ensure good metal-to-metal contact, and grease the connections after each cleaning to protect them against rusting.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Be always in the know as to the state of charge of the battery. The simplest way to tell the state of charge is to carry out a hydrometer test. The hydrometer is an instrument for measuring the specific gravity (S.G.) of the battery electrolyte. The S.G. of the electrolyte is indicative of the state of charge.
