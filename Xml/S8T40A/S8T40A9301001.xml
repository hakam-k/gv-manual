Combination Meter Description
</title>
<ptxt>
Combination meter (1) uses signals (information) sent from each control module by CAN communication to control speedometer, tachometer, ECT meter warning light and indicator light (other than headlight auto leveling warning light (if equipped), air bag warning light, low fuel warning light, rear fog light indicator light and turn signal indicator light).
</ptxt>

Outside air temperature
</title>

<item>
<ptxt>
BCM calculates outside air temperature using signal from outside air temperature sensor and sends outside air temperature signal through CAN communication to combination meter. Then, combination meter makes LCD (outside air temperature) display current outside air temperature based on outside air temperature signal.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Display range of outside air temperature is from &#8211;30 &#176;C (&#8211;22 &#176;F) to 50 &#176;C (122 &#176;F). When ignition switch is turned on, &#8220;-- &#176;C&#8221; appears on LCD until outside air temperature signal is received. Also, when outside air temperature drops to 3 &#176;C (37.4 &#176;F) or lower, message to warn driver of frozen road surface is displayed on LCD.
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<list1 type = "unordered">

As value displayed on LCD is temperature detected at outside air temperature sensor, actual outside air temperature when freezing mark turns on is supposedly about 0 &#176;C (32 &#176;F).

Message in orange color is displayed continuously as long as applicable display condition remains and at the same time, master warning indicator flashes. On the other hand, message in white color is displayed for 5 to 7 seconds continuously and then goes off.
