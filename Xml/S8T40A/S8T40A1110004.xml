Precautions of ECM Circuit Inspection

ECM connectors are waterproofed. Each terminal of the ECM connectors is sealed up with the grommet. Therefore, when measuring circuit voltage, resistance and&#x002F;or pulse signal at ECM connector, do not insert the tester&#8217;s probe into the sealed terminal at the harness side. When measuring circuit voltage, resistance and&#x002F;or pulse signal at ECM connector, connect the special tool to the ECM connectors. And, insert the tester&#8217;s probe into the special tool&#8217;s connectors at the harness side, and then measure voltage, resistance and&#x002F;or pulse signal. Or, ECM and its circuits may be damaged by water.

Wire colors of the special tool&#8217;s connectors are different from the ones of the ECM connectors. However, the circuit arrangement of the special tool&#8217;s connectors is the same as the one of the ECM connectors. Therefore, measure circuit voltage and resistance by identifying the terminal location subject to the measurement.
