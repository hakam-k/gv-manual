Precautions for ECM Circuit Inspection
</title>
<ptxt>
When measuring circuit voltage and&#x002F;or pulse signal at ECM connector, connect the special tool to ECM and ECM connectors while referring to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40A1124063">Inspection of ECM and Its Circuits:J24B</intxref>
 and noting the following.
</ptxt>

<ptxt>
ECM connectors are waterproofed. Each terminal of ECM connectors is sealed with grommet.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Therefore, do not insert the tester probe into sealed terminal from harness side. When measuring circuit voltage and&#x002F;or pulse signal at ECM connector, be sure to connect special tool to ECM connectors and insert tester probe into special tool&#8217;s connectors at harness side. Otherwise, ECM and its circuits may be damaged by water.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Wire colors of special tool&#8217;s connectors are different from those of ECM connectors. 
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
However, terminal arrangement of these connectors are the same as those of ECM connectors. Therefore, be sure to identify terminal location to measure proper terminal.
