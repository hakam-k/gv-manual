The specified engine oil and &#8220;proper engine oil viscosity chart &#x005B;A&#x005D;&#8221; included in this manual are given as typical ones.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The actual engine oil and proper engine oil viscosity, however, vary depending on the vehicle specifications and such typical chart may not be applicable to some models.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Therefore, for the specific information on the engine oil and proper engine oil viscosity, refer to &#8220;Engine Oil and Filter&#8221; section of the Owner&#8217;s Manual.
