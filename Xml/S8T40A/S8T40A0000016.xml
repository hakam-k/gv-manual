Brakes Caution and Note
</title>
<attention2>
<ptxt>
All brake fasteners are important attaching parts in that they could affect the performance of vital parts and systems, and&#x002F;or could result in major repair expense. They must be replaced with one of same part number or with an equivalent part if replacement becomes necessary. Do not use a replacement part of lesser quality or substitute design. Torque values must be used as specified during reassembly to assure proper retention of all parts. There is to be no welding as it may result in extensive damage and weakening of the metal.
