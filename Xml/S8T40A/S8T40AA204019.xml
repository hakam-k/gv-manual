Inspection of BCM and Its Circuits
</title>
<ptxt>
BCM and its circuits can be checked at BCM wiring couplers by measuring voltage and resistance.
</ptxt>
<attention2>
<ptxt>
BCM cannot be checked by itself. It is strictly prohibited to connect voltmeter or ohmmeter to BCM with couplers disconnected from it.
</ptxt>

Voltage Check
</title>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Disconnect negative cable (&#8211;) at battery.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Remove steering column hole cover from instrument panel.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Check voltage at each terminal number of couplers connected.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
For connector and terminal number, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40AA202002">Connector Layout Diagram of BCM</intxref>
