Fastener Caution
</title>
<attention2>
<ptxt>
When fasteners are removed, always reinstall them at the same location from which they were removed. If a fastener needs to be replaced, use the correct part number fastener for that application. If the correct part number fastener is not available, a fastener of equal size and strength (or stronger) may be used. Fasteners that are not reused, and those requiring thread-locking compound, will be called out. The correct torque value must be used when installing fasteners that require it. If the above procedures are not followed, parts or system damage could result.
