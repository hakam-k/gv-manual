Fuel Pressure Basic Inspection
</title>
<attention1>
<ptxt>
When performing the following procedure, be sure to observe 
<intxref refid = "S8T40A1730001">Precautions on Fuel System Service:N32A</intxref>
 in order to reduce the risk of fire and personal injury.
</ptxt>
</attention1>

<ptxt>
Connect special tools and hose between fuel feed hose (1) and fuel feed pipe as shown in figure.
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
When checking fuel pressure, connect special tool firmly with fuel feed line to prevent fuel leakage as it receives high fuel pressure.
