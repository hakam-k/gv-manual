Charging System Circuit
</title>
<ptxt>
The generator features a solid state regulator that is mounted inside the generator. All regulator components are enclosed into a solid mold, and this unit along with the brush holder assembly is attached to the rear housing. The regulator voltage is being controlled by ECM under some conditions while driving. Refer to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40A1111009">Generator Control System Description:M16A and J20A</intxref>
.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The generator rotor bearings contain enough grease to eliminate the need for periodic lubrication.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Two brushes carry current through the two slip rings to the field coil mounted on the rotor, and under normal conditions will provide long period of attention-free service.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The stator windings are assembled inside a laminated core that forms part of the generator frame.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
A rectifier bridge connected to the stator windings contains diodes, and electrically changes the stator AC. voltages to a D.C. voltage which appears at the generator output terminal.
