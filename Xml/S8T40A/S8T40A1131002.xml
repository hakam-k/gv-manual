Type A and type B OBD system
</title>
<ptxt>
ECM in this vehicle has the following functions.
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
When the ignition switch is turned to ON position with the engine stopped, malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) (1) turns on in order to check the MIL (1) and its circuit.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
When ECM detects a malfunction which gives an adverse effect to vehicle emission more than specified driving cycle (D&#x002F;C), it turns on or flashes MIL in the combination meter (flashing only when detecting a misfire which can cause damage to the catalyst) and stores the diagnostic trouble code (DTC) in its memory.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
(If it detects normal condition for continuously three driving cycles are normal after detecting a malfunction, it turns off MIL after engine start in next D&#x002F;C although DTC stored in its memory is remained as a history DTC.)
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
For some malfunctions, ECM adopts the 2 D&#x002F;C detecting logic to prevent erroneous detection. With this logic, MIL is turned on when the malfunction is detected in 2 consecutive D&#x002F;Cs.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
When a malfunction is detected, engine and driving conditions at the moment are stored in ECM memory as freeze frame data.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>

<intxref refid = "S8T40A1131002004">Freeze Frame Data</intxref>

It is possible to communicate ECM via data link connector (DLC) (3) not only by SUZUKI scan tool (SUZUKI-SDT) (2) but also by CAN communication OBD generic scan tool.

Warm-Up Cycle
</title>
<ptxt>
A warm-up cycle means the duration from the engine start until the coolant temperature has risen by at least 23 &#176;C (73 &#176;F) exceeding the minimum temperature of 70 &#176;C (158 &#176;F).

2 Driving Cycle Detection Logic
</title>
<ptxt>
The malfunction detected in the 1st driving cycle is stored in ECM memory (in the form of pending DTC and freeze frame data) but the MIL does not turn on at this time. It turns on at the 2nd detection of the same malfunction in the next driving cycle.

Freeze Frame Data
</title>
<ptxt>
ECM stores the engine and driving conditions at the moment of the detection of a malfunction in its memory. This data is called &#8220;Freeze frame data&#8221;.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
It is possible to know engine and driving conditions (e.g., whether the engine was warm or not, where the vehicle was running or stopped, where air&#x002F;fuel mixture was lean or rich) when a malfunction was detected by checking the freeze frame data. Also, ECM has a function to store each freeze frame data for 3 different malfunctions in the order of their detection. Utilizing this function, it is possible to know the order of detection of these malfunctions. this is helpful when rechecking or diagnosing a trouble.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>

ECM diagnosis troubles which may occur in the engine and emission control system when the ignition switch is ON and the engine is running, and indicates the result by turning on malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) (1).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
ECM and MIL operate as follows.
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
When the ignition switch is turned ON position with the engine stopped, malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) (1) turns on in order to check the MIL and its circuit.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
If the engine and emission control system is free from any trouble after the engine start (while engine is running), MIL turns OFF.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
When ECM detects a malfunction occurred in the engine and emission control system more than specified driving cycle (D&#x002F;C), it turns on MIL in the combination meter and stores the diagnostic trouble code (DTC) in its memory. (The memory is kept as it is even if the trouble was only temporary and disappeared immediately. And it is not erased unless the power to ECM is shut off for specified time or it is cleared by SUZUKI scan tool (SUZUKI-SDT) (2).)

System Readiness Test
</title>
<ptxt>
The system readiness test is to check if the on-board diagnosis of each system related to exhaust emission has been completed or not using a scan tool (Suzuki SDT or CAN communication OBD generic scan tool). When the conditions established for each system are met, ECM performs an on-board diagnosis of corresponding system and changes the status of system readiness test from &#8220;Incomplete&#8221; to &#8220;Complete&#8221;. When &#8220;Complete&#8221; status is displayed, it is maintained until the &#8220;DTC clearance&#8221; is performed using scan tool.
