Coolant Level Check
</title>
<attention1>
<ptxt>
To avoid danger of being burned, do not remove radiator cap while engine and radiator are still hot. Scalding fluid and steam can gush out under pressure if radiator cap is taken off too soon.
</ptxt>
</attention1>
<ptxt>
Lift hood and check coolant level in reservoir.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
It is not necessary to remove radiator cap to check coolant level.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When engine is cool, check coolant level in reservoir (1).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Normal coolant level should be between FULL mark (2) and LOW mark (3) on reservoir cap (4).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If coolant level is below LOW mark (3), add proper coolant to reservoir to bring coolant level up to FULL mark (2).
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
If proper quality antifreeze is used, there is no need to add extra rust inhibitors or other additives that claim to improve system. They may be harmful to proper operation of system, and are unnecessary expense.
