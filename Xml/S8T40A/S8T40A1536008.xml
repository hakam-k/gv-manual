Before draining engine oil, check engine for oil leakage. If any sign of leakage is found, make sure to correct defective part before proceeding to the following procedure.
</ptxt>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Remove engine under cover.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Drain engine oil by removing drain plug (1).
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Wipe drain plug and its mounting surface clean. Reinstall drain plug with new gasket and tighten it to specified torque.

Replenish oil up to FULL level mark on dipstick (oil pan and oil filter capacity). The filler inlet is at top of cylinder head cover. 
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Use only engine oil of SG, SH, SJ, SL or SM grade.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Select the appropriate oil viscosity according to the chart &#x005B;A&#x005D;.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
SAE 0W-20 oil is the best choice for good fuel economy, and good starting in cold weather.

Engine oil capacity is specified below. However, note that the amount of oil required when actually changing oil may somewhat differ from the data depending on various conditions (temperature, viscosity, etc.)
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
The specified engine oil and &#8220;proper engine oil viscosity chart &#x005B;A&#x005D;&#8221; included in this manual are given as typical ones.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The actual engine oil and proper engine oil viscosity, however, vary depending on the vehicle specifications and such typical chart may not be applicable to some models.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Therefore, for the specific information on the engine oil and proper engine oil viscosity, refer to &#8220;Engine Oil and Filter&#8221; section of the Owner&#8217;s Manual.
