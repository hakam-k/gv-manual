Electric Throttle Body System Description
</title>
<ptxt>
The Electric Throttle Body System consists of electric throttle body assembly, accelerator pedal position (APP) sensor assembly, ECM and throttle actuator control relay.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Among them, assembly components are as follows.

Operation Description
</title>
<ptxt>
ECM (5) detects opening (depressed extent of pedal) of the accelerator pedal based on signal voltage of the accelerator pedal position (APP) sensor (1) and using that data and engine operation condition, it calculates the optimum throttle valve opening. On the other hand, it detects the throttle valve opening based on the signal voltage of the throttle position sensor (3) included in the throttle body (2) and compares it with the above calculated optimum throttle valve opening. When there is a difference between them, ECM controls the duty ratio (100&#x0025; &#8211; 0&#x0025;) of throttle actuator control according to this difference to drive the throttle actuator (motor) (4) included in the throttle body. When there is no difference, ECM controls the duty ratio of throttle actuator control to about 15&#x0025; to maintain the throttle valve opening. In this way, the throttle valve (17) is opened and closed to achieve the optimum throttle valve opening.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
In this system, as the throttle position sensor and accelerator pedal position (APP) sensor have 2 sensors (main and sub) each, highly accurate and highly reliable control and abnormality detection are assured. Also, when ECM detects an abnormality in the system, it turns off the throttle actuator control relay (8) to stop controlling the throttle actuator. When the throttle actuator control relay is turned off, the throttle valve is fixed at the opening of about 7&#176; from its completely closed position (default opening) by the force of the return spring and open spring included in the throttle body.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
This throttle body is not equipped with IAC valve for idle speed control. Idle speed control is done by the throttle actuator which opens&#x002F;closes the throttle valve.
