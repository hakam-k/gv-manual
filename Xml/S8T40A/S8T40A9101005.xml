Joint connector (J&#x002F;C)

<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
The joint connector (J&#x002F;C) connects several different wires with the same wire color at one place instead of connecting them by welding or caulking one by one. It is not an ordinary connector but a part of the continuous wire in the harness.
