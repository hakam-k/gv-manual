Coolant Level Check
</title>
<attention1>
<ptxt>
To avoid getting burned, do not remove radiator cap while engine and radiator are still hot. Scalding fluid and steam can gush out under pressure if radiator cap is taken off too soon.
</ptxt>
</attention1>
<ptxt>
To check level, lift hood and look at translucent reservoir.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
It is not necessary to remove radiator cap to check coolant level.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When engine is cool, check coolant level in reservoir (1).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Normal coolant level should be between FULL mark (2) and LOW mark (3) on reservoir (1).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If coolant level is below LOW mark (3), remove reservoir cap (4) and add proper coolant to reservoir to bring coolant level up to FULL mark (2).
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
If proper quality antifreeze is used, there is no need to add extra rust inhibitors or other additives that claim to improve system. They may be harmful to proper operation of system, and are unnecessary expense.
