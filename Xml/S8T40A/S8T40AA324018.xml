<intxrefpoff refid = "S8T40AA322001">Immobilizer Control System Wiring Circuit Diagram:Diesel Engine Model</intxrefpoff>
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
ICM and its circuit can be checked at ICM wiring connector by measuring voltage.
</ptxt>
<attention2>
<ptxt>
ICM cannot be checked by itself. It is strictly prohibited to connect voltmeter or ohmmeter to ICM with connector disconnected from it.

Voltage Check
</title>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Remove ICM (1) from steering lock assembly or steering lock unit referring to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40AA326001">Immobilizer Control Module (ICM) Removal and Installation:Diesel Engine Model</intxref>
.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Connect ICM connector (2) to ICM.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Check voltage at each terminal.
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
As each terminal voltage is affected by the battery voltage, confirm that it is 12 V or more when the ignition switch is turned to ON position.
