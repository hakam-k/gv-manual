On-Board Diagnostic System Description
</title>
<ptxt>
ECM in this vehicle has the following functions.
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
When the ignition switch is turned ON with the engine at a stop, MIL (1), turns ON to check the warning light and its circuit.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
When ECM detects a malfunction, it makes injection warning light (gravity 1 fault) (2) and&#x002F;or red stop warning light (gravity 2 fault) (3) in the meter cluster of the instrument panel turn ON and stores the malfunction area in its memory.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
When ECM detects a malfunction which gives an adverse effect to vehicle emission while the engine is running, it makes the malfunction indicator lamp in the meter cluster of the instrument panel turn ON and stores the malfunction area in its memory.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
When a malfunction is detected, a malfunction in some areas in the system and driving cycles then are stored in ECM memory (For the details, refer to description on

Warm-Up Cycle
</title>
<ptxt>
A &#8220;warm-up cycle&#8221; means sufficient vehicle operation such that the coolant temperature has risen by at least 22 &#176;C (40 &#176;F) from engine starting and reaches a minimum temperature of 70 &#176;C (160 &#176;F).
</ptxt>

<servinfosub id = "S8T40A1141003002">
<title>
Driving Cycle
</title>
<ptxt>
A &#8220;driving cycle&#8221; consists of two parts, engine startup and engine shutoff. 
</ptxt>

<servinfosub id = "S8T40A1141003003">
<title>
3 Driving Cycle Detection Logic
</title>
<ptxt>
The malfunction detected in the first driving cycle is stored in ECM memory (in the form of pending DTC) but the malfunction indicator lamp does not light at this time. 
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
It does not light up at the second detection of same malfunction also in the next driving cycle. It lights up at the third detection of same malfunction also in the third driving cycle.
</ptxt>
</servinfosub>
<servinfosub id = "S8T40A1141003004">
<title>
Pending Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC)
</title>
<ptxt>
Pending DTC means a DTC detected and stored temporarily at first or second driving cycle of the DTC which is detected in the 3 driving cycle detection logic.

Data Link Connector (DLC)
</title>
<ptxt>
DLC (1) is in compliance with SAE J1962 in its installation position, the shape of connector and pin assignment. 
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
K line (3) of ISO 9141 is used for SUZUKI scan tool or OBD generic scan tool to communicate with ECM, Air bag SDM, immobilizer control module, BCM (Body electrical Control Module), 4WD control module and ABS &#x002F; ESP&#174; control module.
