Generator Test (Undercharged Battery Check)
</title>
<ptxt>
This condition, as evidenced by slow cranking or indicator clear with dark or light yellow dot can be caused by one or more of the following conditions even though indicator lamp may be operating normal.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The following procedure also applies to cars with voltmeter and ammeter.
</ptxt>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Make sure that undercharged condition has not been caused by accessories left on for extended period of time.
</ptxt>
</s1>

<ptxt>
Check drive belt for proper tension.

.
</ptxt>
</s1>

<ptxt>
Inspect wiring for defects. Check all connections for tightness and cleanliness, battery cable connections at battery, starting motor, ignition ground cable and no &#8220;C&#8221; terminal circuit at ground.
</ptxt>
