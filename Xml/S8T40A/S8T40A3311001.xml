Transfer Description
</title>
<ptxt>
The transfer is directly connected to the transmission and consists of case, input gear, counter gear, rear output shaft, front output shaft, center differential, drive chain and their accompanying gears, hubs, sleeves, fork, etc.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
There are two kinds of center differential assembled in the transfer. One is the torque induction type LSD adopted in the non-ESP&#174; model, the other is the two pinion type center differential adopted in the ESP&#174; model. When a rotation difference between front and rear wheels is occurring, in the non-ESP&#174; model differential is restricted by the torque induction type LSD, while in the ESP&#174; model it is restricted by the ESP&#174; system instead of LSD.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The transfer has such a selective mechanism as to enable the shift actuator to make selection of high speed (direct connection with transmission output: main shaft), low speed (speed reduction by input gear, counter gear and low gear) or neutral by way of the reduction shift sleeve located between the input gear and low gear, and selection of center differential lock or not by way of the differential lock clutch sleeve located at the center of the rear output shaft.

The case has an oil pump to provide proper lubrication.
