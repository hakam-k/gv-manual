Scan Tool Data

<ptxt>
As the data values below are standard values estimated on the basis of values obtained from the normally operating vehicles by using a SUZUKI scan tool, use them as reference values. Even when the vehicle is in good condition, there may be cases where the checked value does not fall within each specified data range. Therefore, judgment as abnormal should not be made by checking with these data alone. Also, conditions that can be checked by the SUZUKI scan tool are those detected by ECM and output from ECM as commands and there may be cases where the engine or actuator is not operating (in the condition) as indicated by the SUZUKI scan tool.

When checking the data with the engine running at idle or racing, be sure to shift M&#x002F;T gear to the neutral position and pull the parking brake fully. Also, if nothing or &#8220;no load&#8221; is indicated, turn OFF A&#x002F;C, all electric loads and all the other necessary switches.
