Cooling System Flush and Refill
</title>
<attention1>
<ptxt>
To help avoid danger of being burned, do not remove radiator cap while engine and radiator are still hot. Scalding fluid and steam can be blown out under pressure if cap is taken off too soon.
</ptxt>
</attention1>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
For detail of coolant specification, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40A1611002">Coolant Description:M16A and J20A</intxref>
.
</ptxt>
</attention3>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Remove radiator cap as follows when engine is cool.
</ptxt>
<s2>
<ptxt>
Turn cap counterclockwise slowly until it reaches a &#8220;stop&#8221; (Do not press down while turning it).
</ptxt>
</s2>
<s2>
<ptxt>
Wait until pressure is relieved (indicated by a hissing sound) then press down on cap and continue to turn it counterclockwise.
</ptxt>
</s2>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
With radiator cap removed, run engine until upper radiator hose is hot (this shows that thermostat is open and coolant is flowing through system).
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Stop engine and drain coolant from radiator drain plug (1).
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Close radiator drain plug. Add water until system is filled and run engine until upper radiator hose is hot again.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Repeat Steps 3) and 4) several times until drained liquid is nearly colorless.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Close radiator drain plug (1) tightly.

Remove reservoir (1) and remove cap (2) from reservoir (1).
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Pour out any fluid, scrub and clean inside of reservoir with soap and water.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Flush it well with clean water and drain, Reinstall reservoir.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Fill reservoir with coolant up to &#8220;FULL&#8221; level mark (3).
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Install reservoir cap (2) on reservoir.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Fill radiator with coolant up to bottom of radiator filler neck and install radiator cap, making sure that the ear of cap lines is parallel to radiator.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Run engine at idle speed.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Run engine until radiator fan motor is operated.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Stop engine and wait until engine comes cooled down to help avoid danger of being burned.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Add coolant to radiator up to bottom of radiator filler neck, and install radiator cap, making sure that the ear of cap lines is parallel to radiator.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Repeat Step 12) through 15).
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Confirm that reservoir coolant level is &#8220;FULL&#8221; level mark (3). If coolant is insufficient, repeat Step 9) and 10).
