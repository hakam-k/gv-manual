Air Intake System Description
</title>
<ptxt>
The main components of the air intake system are air cleaner (1), air cleaner outlet hose (2), throttle body (3) (for details, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S8T40A1131006">Description of Electric Throttle Control System:N32A</intxref>
.) and intake manifold (4). The air (the amount corresponding to throttle valve (5) opening and engine speed) is filtered by the air cleaner, distributed through the intake manifold, and finally drawn into each combustion chamber. Throttle body is not equipped with IAC valve for idle speed control. Idle speed control is operated by the throttle actuator (6) which opens and closes the throttle valve. (For details, refer to
