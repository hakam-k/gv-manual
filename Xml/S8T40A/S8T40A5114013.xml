The purpose of this test is to judge whether causal factor of trouble which occurred in automatic transmission is electrical or mechanical by disconnecting solenoid connector (1) and fixing automatic transmission gear position (fail-safe function).
</ptxt>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Start engine and warm it up to normal operating temperature.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
After warming up engine, turn ignition switch to OFF position and disconnect solenoid connector (1).

With shift select lever shifted to each range (&#8220;L&#8221;, &#8220;2&#8221;, &#8220;3&#8221; and &#8220;D&#8221;) drive vehicle at 1,000 rpm engine speed and then check vehicle speed by referring to &#8220;Fixed gear position&#8221;.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If vehicle speed is not as specified in &#8220;Fixed gear position&#8221; table, go to troubleshooting.
