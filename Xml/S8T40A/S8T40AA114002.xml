Inspection of Cruise Control System Circuit
</title>
<ptxt>
Cruise control system is controlled by ECM. Each switch and circuit can be checked by taking measurement of terminal voltage and terminal to terminal resistance of ECM. When measuring these values, be sure to read precautions for measurement described under 
<intxref refid = "S8T40A1114080">Inspection of ECM and Its Circuits:M16A and J20A</intxref>
