</title>
<ptxt>
The auto-on headlight is controlled by BCM (1) and works as follows. Under such conditions as the ignition switch turned ON, the lighting switch (2) turned to the &#8220;AUTO&#8221; position and the parking brake released, when illuminance to the auto-on headlight sensor (3) becomes lower than the specified value, the headlights and clearance lights are turned ON by BCM. On the other hand, when illuminance to the auto-on headlight sensor becomes higher than the specified value under the same conditions, the headlights and clearance lights are turned OFF by BCM.
