Engine Cooling System Inspection and Cleaning
</title>
<attention1>
<ptxt>
To avoid danger of being burned, do not remove radiator cap while engine and radiator are still hot. Scalding fluid and steam can gush out under pressure if cap is taken off too soon.
</ptxt>
</attention1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Check cooling system for leakage or damage.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Wash radiator cap and filler neck with clean water by removing radiator cap when engine is cold.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Check coolant for proper level and freeze protection.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Check cooling system as follows.
</ptxt>
<s2>
<ptxt>
Install pressure tester (1) to radiator filler neck and apply specified pressure to pressurize cooling system.
</ptxt>
<spec>
<title>
Cooling system holding pressure
</title>
<ptxt>
110 kPa (1.1 kgf&#x002F;cm&#x00B2;, 15.6 psi)
</ptxt>
</spec>
</s2>
<s2>
<ptxt>
Check that cooling system holds applied pressure. If it does not hold the pressure, check that there is no coolant leakage in cooling system.
</ptxt>

<s2>
<ptxt>
Install pressure tester (1) to radiator cap (2) and apply specified pressure is put on radiator cap.

<ptxt>
110 kPa (1.1 kgf&#x002F;cm&#x00B2;, 15.6 psi)
</ptxt>
</spec>
</s2>
<s2>
<ptxt>
In case a pressure higher than specified value is applied to radiator cap, check if pressure is relieved.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
In case pressure is not relieved even if a pressure larger than specified value is applied to radiator cap, or in case pressure is relieved when a pressure lower than specified value is applied, replace radiator cap.
</ptxt>

<ptxt>
Remove pressure tester and wipe off adherent coolant of the tester.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Install radiator cap to radiator filler neck of radiator.
</ptxt>
<attention2>
<ptxt>
After installing radiator cap to radiator, make sure that the ling formed by lugs of cap is parallel to radiator top.
