DTC P0606: ECM &#x002F; PCM Processor Malfunction
</title>
<attention3>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
DTC P0606 D6 (current) will be detected rarely even if system is in normal condition when connecting battery with IG ON and it can&#8217;t be cleared using normal procedure described in 
<intxref refid = "S5JB0B1104006">DTC Clearance</intxref>
.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
In this case, clear DTC P0606 D6 as follows.
</ptxt>
</item>
<list2 type = "ordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Connect SUZUKI scan tool to DLC with IG switch OFF.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Turn IG switch to ON position.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Select &#8220;Clear DTC (current P0606 D6)&#8221; under &#8220;Trouble Code&#8221; mode of SUZUKI scan tool and follow instructions displayed on SUZUKI scan tool.

Conditions for applying fault finding procedures to stored faults:
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The fault is declared present after an attempted start, or with the engine running.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
If 6.DEF, 8.DEF, 12.DEF is present, the Injection warning light (gravity 1 warning light) is lit.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
If one of the other faults is present, the Red stop warning light (gravity 2 warning light) is lit.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
If 6.DEF is still present, the Malfunction indicator light (MIL) will come on after three consecutive driving cycles (starting &#x002B;5 seconds &#x002B; turn OFF ignition switch and wait 40 seconds.).
</ptxt>
