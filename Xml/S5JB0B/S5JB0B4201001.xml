Front Disc Brake Caliper Assembly Construction
</title>
<ptxt>
This caliper is mounted to the brake caliper carrier with two caliper pin bolts. Hydraulic force, created by applying force to the brake pedal, is converted by the caliper to friction. The hydraulic force acts equally against the piston and the bottom of the caliper bore to move the piston outward and to move (slide) the caliper inward, resulting in a clamping action on the disc. This clamping action forces the pads (linings) against the disc, creating friction to stop the vehicle.

Lubricate parts as specified. Do not use lubricated shop air on brake parts as damage to rubber components may result. If any component is removed or line disconnected, bleed the brake system.

Replace pads in axle sets only. The torque values specified are for dry, unlubricated fasteners.
