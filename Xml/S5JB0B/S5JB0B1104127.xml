To locate any faulty sensor and&#x002F;or connection, disconnect one of the sensors then check whether the fault becomes stored.

If the fault is still present, repeat the operation with the other sensors.
</ptxt>

(Wait a few seconds between each disconnection to allow the ECM to make the measurement).
</ptxt>

If the fault is stored after a disconnection, change the faulty sensor or repair its connection.

Clear the faults created by the multiple disconnections.
