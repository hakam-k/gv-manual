DTC P0560: System Voltage Malfunction
</title>
<attention3>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Conditions for applying fault finding procedures to stored faults:
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The fault is declared present following a road test or after attempting to start the engine several times.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
ECM operating voltage: 9 V &lt; operating voltage &lt; 16 V.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Battery voltage that is too low can cause the level 1 fault warning light to come on thereby causing other faults to appear.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
It is then not possible to start the engine.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Use service wire for all operations on the ECM connectors.

With ignition switch OFF, measure the voltage across the battery terminals.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If the voltage is less than 11.5 V, test the battery.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If the battery is faulty, replace the battery then test the charge circuit.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
With ignition switch ON and the with the starter motor turning, measure the voltage across the battery terminals.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If the voltage drops below 9.6 V, check the tightness and condition of the battery terminals.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Repair if necessary.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If the terminals are in good condition, test the battery.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If they are faulty, replace the battery.
