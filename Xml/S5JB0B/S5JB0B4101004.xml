Master Cylinder Assembly Construction
</title>
<ptxt>
The master cylinder has two pistons, two pressure seal (3) and two separating seal (4). Its hydraulic pressure is produced in the primary (A in the figure) and secondary (B) chambers. The hydraulic pressure produced in the primary chamber (A) acts on the front right and rear left brakes.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Also, the hydraulic pressure produced in the secondary chamber (B) acts on the front left and rear right brakes.
</ptxt>
<attention1>
<ptxt>
Brake master cylinder cannot be disassembled. When anything faulty is found in it, it must be replaced as an assembly.
</ptxt>
</attention1>
<attention2>
<ptxt>
Brake master cylinder cannot be disassembled in principle. Should primary piston (1) have come off from cylinder while dismounting or handling it, wash it in the same specified fluid as that in reservoir and place it back in cylinder.
