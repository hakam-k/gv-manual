Transfer Description
</title>
<ptxt>
The aluminum transfer case directly connected to the back of the transmission contains input gear, counter gear, rear output shaft, front output shaft, center differential, drive chain and their accompanying gears, hubs, sleeves, fork, etc.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The center differential is installed in the transfer. With the torque induction type LSD used in the center differential, the effect of LSD works when a rotation difference between front and rear wheels is occurring.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The transfer has such a selective mechanism as to enable the shift actuator to make selection of high speed (direct connection with transmission output: main shaft), low speed (speed reduction by input gear, counter gear and low gear) or neutral by way of the reduction shift sleeve located between the input gear and low gear, and selection of center differential lock or not by way of the differential lock clutch sleeve located at the center of the rear output shaft.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The case has an oil pump to provide proper lubrication.
