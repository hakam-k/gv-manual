Priorities when dealing with a number of faults:

<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Differential pressure sensor.
</ptxt>
</item>

Boost pressure sensor.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Accelerator pedal position (APP) sensor (main).
</ptxt>
</item>
</list1>
<ptxt>
To locate any faulty sensor and&#x002F;or connection, disconnect one of these sensors then check whether the fault becomes stored.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If the fault is still present, start the operation again with the other sensor.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
(Wait a few seconds between each disconnection to allow the ECM to make the measurement).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If the fault is stored after a disconnection, change the faulty sensor or repair its connection.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Clear the faults created by the multiple disconnections.
