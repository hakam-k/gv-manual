Generator Test (Undercharged Battery Check)
</title>
<ptxt>
This condition, as evidenced by slow cranking or low specific gravity can be caused by one or more of the following conditions even though indicator lamp may be operating normal. The following procedure also applies to cars with voltmeter and ammeter.
