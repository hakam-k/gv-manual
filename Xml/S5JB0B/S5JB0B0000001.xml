Precautions for Vehicles Equipped with a Supplemental Restraint (Air Bag) System
</title>
<attention1>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
The configuration of air bag system parts are as shown in the figure. When it is necessary to service (remove, reinstall and inspect) these parts, be sure to follow procedures described in 
<intxref refid = "S5JB0B8200001">Precautions on Service and Diagnosis of Air Bag System</intxref>
. Failure to follow proper procedures could result in possible air bag system activation, personal injury, damage to parts or air bag system being unable to activate when necessary.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
If the air bag system and another vehicle system both need repair, SUZUKI recommends that the air bag system be repaired first, to help avoid unintended air bag system activation.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Do not modify the steering wheel, dashboard, or any other air bag system components.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Modifications can adversely affect air bag system performance and lead to injury.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
If the vehicle will be exposed to temperatures over 93 &#176;C (200 &#176;F) (for example, during a paint baking process), remove the air bag system components beforehand to avoid component damage or unintended air bag system activation.

Never attempt to measure the resistance of the air bag (inflator) modules (driver, passenger, side and curtain) and seat belt pretensioners (driver and passenger). It is very dangerous as the electric current from the tester may deploy the air bag or activate the pretensioners.

Servicing and Handling
</title>
<attention1>
<ptxt>
Many of service procedures require disconnection of &#8220;A&#x002F;B&#8221; fuse and all air bag (inflator) module(s) from system circuit to avoid an accidental deployment.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Driver, Passenger, Side and Curtain Air Bag (Inflator) Modules
</ptxt>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
For handling and storage of a live air bag (inflator) module, select a place where the ambient temperature below 65 &#176;C (150 &#176;F), without high humidity and away from electric noise.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
When carrying a live air bag (inflator) module, make sure the bag opening is pointed away from you. In case of an accidental deployment, the bag will then deploy with minimal chance of injury. Never carry the air bag (inflator) module by the wires or connector on the underside of the module. When placing a live air bag (inflator) module on a bench or other surface, always face the bag up, away from the surface. This is necessary so that a free space is provided to allow the air bag to expand in the unlikely event of accidental deployment. Otherwise, personal injury may result.

Never dispose of live (undeployed) air bag (inflator) modules (driver, passenger, side and curtain). If disposal is necessary, be sure to deploy them according to deployment procedures described in

The air bag (inflator) module immediately after deployment is very hot. Wait for at least half an hour to cool it off before proceeding the work.

After an air bag (inflator) module has been deployed, the surface of the air bag may contain a powdery residue. This powder consists primarily of cornstarch (used to lubricate the bag as it inflates) and by-products of the chemical reaction. As with many service procedures, gloves and safety glasses should be worn.

</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Never strike or jar the SDM.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Never power up the air bag system when the SDM is not rigidly attached to the vehicle. All SDM and mounting bracket fasteners must be carefully torqued and the arrow must be pointing toward the front of the vehicle to ensure proper operation of the air bag system.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The SDM could be activated when powered while not rigidly attached to the vehicle which could cause deployment and result in personal injury.

Driver and Passenger Seat Belt Pretensioners

For handling and storage of a live seat belt pretensioner, select a place where the ambient temperature below 65 &#176;C (150 &#176;F), without high humidity and away from electric noise.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Never carry seat belt pretensioner by wire or connector of pretensioner. When placing a live seat belt pretensioner on the workbench or some place like that, be sure not to lay it with its exhaust hole (1) provided side facing down. It is also prohibited to put something on its face with an exhaust hole or to put a seat belt pretensioner on top of another. Otherwise, personal injury may result.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Never dispose of live (inactivated) seat belt pretensioners (drive and passenger). If disposal is necessary, be sure to activate them according to activation procedures described in 
<intxref refid = "S5JB0B8206017">Air Bag (Inflator) Module and Seat Belt Pretensioner Disposal</intxref>
 before disposal.

Even when the accident was light enough not to cause air bags to activate, be sure to inspect system parts and other related parts according to instructions under

When servicing parts other than air bag system, if shocks may be applied to air bag system component parts, remove those parts beforehand.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
When handling the air bag (inflator) modules (driver, passenger, side and curtain), forward sensors, side sensors or SDM, be careful not to drop it or apply an impact to it. If an excessive impact was applied (e.g., dropped from a height of 91.4 cm (3 feet) or more), never attempt disassembly or repair but replace it with a new one.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
When grease, cleaning agent, oil, water, etc. has got onto air bag (inflator) modules (driver, passenger, side and curtain), wipe off immediately with a dry cloth.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Air bag wire harness is included in main harness, instrument panel harness, floor harness and seat harness. Air bag wire harness can be identified easily as the part of connector side wire harness is covered with a yellow protection tube and it has yellow connectors. Be very careful when handling it.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
When an open in air bag wire harness, damaged wire harness, connector or terminal is found, replace wire harness, connectors and terminals as an assembly.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Do not apply power to the air bag system unless all components are connected or a diagnostic flow requests it, as this will set a DTC.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Never use air bag system component parts from another vehicle.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
When using electric welding, be sure to temporarily disable air bag system referring to 
<intxref refid = "S5JB0B8206001">Disabling Air Bag System</intxref>
.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Never expose air bag system component parts directly to hot air (drying or baking the vehicle after painting) or flames.
