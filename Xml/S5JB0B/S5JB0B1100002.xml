Precautions in Diagnosing Trouble
</title>
<list1 type = "unordered">
<item>
<ptxt>
Don&#8217;t disconnect couplers from ECM, battery cable from battery, ECM ground wire harness from engine or main fuse before confirming diagnostic information (DTC) stored in ECM memory.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Diagnostic information stored in ECM memory can be cleared as well as checked by using SUZUKI scan tool or OBD generic scan tool. Before using scan tool, read its Operator&#8217;s (Instruction) Manual carefully to have good understanding as to what functions are available and how to use it.

Be sure to read 
<intxref refid = "S5JB0B0000006">Precautions for Electrical Circuit Service</intxref>
 before inspection and observe what is written there.

Replacement of the ECM
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Before replacement of the ECM, save the data of vehicle specification (injector calibration code, EGR &#x002F; Inlet throttle valve data register and Diesel PF data register) into SUZUKI scan tool from ECM according to procedure described in 
<intxref refid = "S5JB0B1301001">Description of ECM Registration</intxref>
.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
ECM registration:
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If ECM is replaced, register vehicle specification (fuel injector calibration code, key verification code for immobilizer system) into ECM referring to 
<intxref refid = "S5JB0B1301001">Description of ECM Registration</intxref>
.
</ptxt>
</item>
<item>
<ptxt>
Communication of ECM, BCM, combination meter, ABS or ESP&#174; control module, immobilizer control module and 4WD control module, is established by CAN (Controller Area Network). (For more detail of CAN communication for ECM, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S5JB0B1101005">CAN Communication System Description</intxref>
).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Therefore, handle CAN communication line with care referring to 
<intxref refid = "S5JB0B0000005">Precaution for CAN Communication System</intxref>
.

Immobilizer transponder code registration after replacing ECM
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When ECM is replaced with new one or with another one, make sure to register immobilizer transponder code to ECM correctly according to 
<intxref refid = "S5JB0BA306003">Procedure after ECM Replacement</intxref>
