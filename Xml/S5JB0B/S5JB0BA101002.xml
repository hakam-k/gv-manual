ECM executes centralized control over all functions including setting a constant speed, resuming it, setting coast, cancelling cruise control limiting minimum speed.
</ptxt>

ECM controls fuel injector to keep actual vehicle speed at set (target) speed.

<ptxt>
When this switch is pressed (ON) and then released (OFF) while vehicle is running at a speed 40 km&#x002F;h (25 mile&#x002F;h) or higher, vehicle speed at that OFF moment is stored in memory and it is maintained (constant cruising).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
Pressing this switch (ON) continuously during constant cruising keeps slowing down vehicle speed as long as it is ON. When it is released (OFF), vehicle speed at that moment is stored in memory and vehicle starts constant cruising.

<ptxt>
When this switch is pressed (ON) during constant cruising, vehicle speed keeps increasing as long as it is ON. When it is released (OFF), vehicle speed at that moment is stored in memory and vehicle starts constant cruising. If vehicle speed is higher than 40 km&#x002F;h (25 mile&#x002F;h) after cruise control is cancelled, pressing this switch ON momentarily will resume the speed at which vehicle was running before cancellation.

<ptxt>
Brake light switch has 2 contact points. One contact point closes when brake pedal is depressed to light brake light and provides a voltage signal to the ECM.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
The other contact point (brake pedal position switch) opens when brake pedal is depressed, to shut off power to cruise control of ECM, thereby cancelling cruise control.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
This switch is installed to cancel cruise control (constant cruising).
