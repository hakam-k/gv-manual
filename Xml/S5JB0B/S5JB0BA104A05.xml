ECM uses ABS or ESP&#174; control module and CAN communication to transmit and receive data for cruise control. Therefore, check that no DTC is detected in ECM and ABS or ESP&#174; control module before performing this Cruise Control System Symptom Diagnosis. If DTC is detected, correct trouble indicated by that DTC first.
