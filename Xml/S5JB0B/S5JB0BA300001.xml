Before confirming the diagnostic trouble code (DTC), do not disconnect connector from immobilizer control module (ICM), battery cable from battery, ground wire harness, or main fuse. Such disconnection will erase DTC stored in ICM.

DTC stored in ICM memory can be checked as well as cleared by using SUZUKI scan tool. Before using SUZUKI scan tool, read its operator&#8217;s manual carefully to know how to use it and what functions are available.

Communication of ECM, BCM, combination meter, ABS&#x002F;ESP&#174; control module, immobilizer control module, 4WD control module and steering angle sensor (if equipped) is established by CAN (Computer Area Network). (For more detail of CAN communication, refer to 
<intxref refid = "S5JB0B1101005">CAN Communication System Description</intxref>
) Therefore, handle CAN communication lines with care referring to 
<intxref refid = "S5JB0B0000005">Precaution for CAN Communication System</intxref>
