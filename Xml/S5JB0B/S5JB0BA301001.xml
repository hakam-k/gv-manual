A code called the transponder code is memorized in the transponder. And, the code is registered with ECM. Basically, when the ignition switch is turned ON, ECM reads the code by the coil antenna. When that code agrees with the ICM registered code, ICM compares the secret code with ECM. When their secret codes agree, the engine can be started.If there is no agreement between transponder codes of ICM and ignition key or between secret codes of ICM and ECM, ECM stops fuel injection to prevent the engine from starting and turn the injection warning light ON and OFF using CAN communication line.
