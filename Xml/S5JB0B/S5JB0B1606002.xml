Coolant Level Check
</title>
<attention1>
<ptxt>
To help avoid danger of being burned, do not remove degassing tank cap while engine and radiator are still hot. Scalding fluid and steam can be blown out under pressure if degassing tank cap is taken off too soon.
</ptxt>
</attention1>
<ptxt>
To check level, lift hood and look at &#8220;see-through&#8221; degassing tank.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
It is not necessary to remove degassing tank cap to check coolant level.
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
When engine is cool, check coolant level in degassing tank (1).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
A normal coolant level should be between &#8220;MAXI&#8221; mark (2) and &#8220;MINI&#8221; mark (3) on degassing tank (1).
</ptxt>
<ptxt>
If coolant level is below &#8220;MINI&#8221; mark (3), remove degassing tank cap (4) and add proper coolant to degassing tank to bring coolant level up to &#8220;MAXI&#8221; mark (2).
</ptxt>
<attention3>
<ptxt>
If proper quality antifreeze is used, there is no need to add extra inhibitors or additives that claim to improve system. They may be harmful to proper operation of system, and are unnecessary expense.
