Refer to &ldquo;Air Bag System Components and Wiring Location View&rdquo; under &ldquo;General Description&rdquo; in air bag system section in order to confirm whether you are performing service on or near the air bag system components or wiring. Please observe all WARNINGS and &ldquo;Service Precautions&rdquo; under &ldquo;On-Vehicle Service&rdquo; in air bag system section before performing service on or around the air bag system components or wiring.
