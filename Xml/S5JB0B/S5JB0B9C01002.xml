Reference
</title>
<ptxt>
Plastic parts employ not only ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) plastic but also polypropylene, vinyl, or the like plastic. Burning test method to identify ABS plastic is described below.
</ptxt>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Use a sharp blade to cut off a plastic sliver from the part at its hidden backside.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Hold sliver with pincers and set it on fire.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Carefully observe condition of the burning plastic.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
ABS plastic must raise readily distinguishable back smoke while burning with its residue suspended in air temporarily.
</ptxt>
</s1>
<s1>
<ptxt>
Polypropylene must raise no readily distinguishable smoke while burning.
