Communication of ECM, BCM, ABS (ESP&#174;) control module (if equipped), 4WD control module (if equipped), immobilizer control module (ICM) (if equipped), combination meter and steering angle sensor (if equipped) is established by CAN (Controller Area Network).Therefore, be sure to read 
<intxref refid = "S5JB0B0000007">Precautions for Installing Mobile Communication Equipment</intxref>
 before inspection and handle CAN communication line.
